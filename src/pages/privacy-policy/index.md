#### What personal data we collect

The only data we collect are the details you give us when you sign up. This will include an email address, a name, the region you are in and a message you type. We encourage and fully support anonymous contact!

#### Cookies

We don't set cookies.

#### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g.
videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in
the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional
third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content,
including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an
account and are logged in to that website.

#### Analytics

We don't track you over the Internet or give any of your data to anyone else. We do however record strictly anonymous information about pages that you entered the site from, and which pages you looked at when you're here. This is only done to help us better understand how we can improve the site flow.

#### Who we share your data with and how long we retain it

If you sign up using the contact form we will store that data on Extinction Rebellion's community owned servers in a strongly encrypted form. We do not (and will never) share it with anyone else. If you wish that data to be deleted at some later point, please [get in touch](/contact-us/) and it will be done.

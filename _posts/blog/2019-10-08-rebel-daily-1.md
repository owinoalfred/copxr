October 08, 2019 by Extinction Rebellion

**International Rebellion is here. And it's bigger and more beautiful
than we dared to imagine. This is what mass civil disobedience looks
like.**

It's happening. It can't be ignored. It's only growing stronger.

It's a rebellion.

We're back on the roads -- with as much joy, fear, love and courage as
ever. We're shutting down cities -- not because it's fun (though it can
be), but because it's our last option for stopping this toxic system in
its tracks. Our world is dying; to save it, we'll need everyone --
wherever and whoever you are -- to do your bit.

![](/assets/img/blog/2019/10/07/pasted%20image%200.jpg){:.img-fluid style="width:750px;"}
{:.text-center}

And though we're still somewhat short of the shared, global
consciousness we need, we're getting ever closer.

This International Rebellion which began on Monday is so vast it's
almost impossible to take it all in. Thousands of people flood 60 cities
across the globe, with over 700 brave rebels arrested as they stand up
for their right to life, and that's just the start.

It's not just a question of quantity. With every season that passes, we
grow more organised, more unified, more creative, more courageous.

Just look at the [11 vibrant
sites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEZki7uI-bY&feature=youtu.be)
held around the centre of London, the choir of Amsterdam rebels, the
blood [poured on the bull
statue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0bh_LDrxC0&feature=youtu.be) in
Wall Street in New York, the ambition of our banner-hangers, the Red
Brigade arriving in Tel Aviv and Istanbul, underwater protest art in
Mexico, the boats of every shape and size that we are so desperately
trying to keep afloat.

We're a movement unlike any other.

{:.text-center}

This newsletter team will do everything we can to keep up and to
showcase the unreal brilliance of our young movement. We can only
apologise in advance for not capturing every aspect of this glorious,
unfathomably complex process that is our rebellion.

We hope that wherever this reaches you -- whether you're superglued to a
road, camping out in the rain, deep in spreadsheets and planning, or at
home drinking your coffee -- you will be touched by what is going on
right now all over the world. We hope you understand that it's for you,
and for every human being alive and not yet alive.

You are not alone in this beautiful mess. And it's not too late to join
in.

Global Highlights
-----------------

### London Blockades Westminster

**7 OCT \| London, UK**

![](/assets/img/blog/2019/10/07/unnamed-min.jpg){:.img-fluid style="width:750px;"}
{:.text-center}

"How we have grown" --- The Red Rebel Brigade, London

Over 275 rebels have been arrested on [a momentous
day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEZki7uI-bY&feature=youtu.be) which
marks the beginning of XR's October Rebellion in London. Early on Monday
morning, rebels from all over the country mobilised and successfully
took 11 main sites around Westminster in central London, including two
key bridges.

Rebels drove a hearse into the 'Burning Earth' site in **Trafalgar
Square**, parked it, and locked and glued themselves to the vehicle. The
'undertaker' in the drivers' seat D-locked his own neck to the steering
wheel.

[Footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjVH0VEmGK4) broadcast on ITV
News shows police officers desperately trying to prevent more rebels
gluing themselves underneath the vehicle, as well as a [deeply
moving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjVH0VEmGK4) moment where a
father locked onto the underside of the hearse reveals why he is taking
this drastic measure. In the back of the hearse, rebels had mounted a
coffin painted with the words 'OUR FUTURE'.

![](/assets/img/blog/2019/10/07/unnamed-1-min.jpg){:.img-fluid style="width:750px;"}
{:.text-center}

Meanwhile, a tower of scaffolding was positioned in the road, which
rebels climbed and glued onto. They held this for most of the day,
before being lifted off in orange sacks by police officers kitted out in
climbing gear. Latest videos show rebels still going strong, including
those attached to and inside the hearse.

In an exciting turn of events, [a rebel
wedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=zXlwIWFtLMI)
was held in the middle of the blocked **Westminster Bridge** (a first
for the bridge, as far as we know!) to the sound of XR cheers and a
feisty brass band. Love was truly in the air.

Also seen on the bridge were yoga enthusiasts, a ceilidh with bagpipes,
and, floating beneath the bridge, an XR boat headed for the Houses of
Parliament. XR filled the road outside Downing Street, blockaded
Westminster Bridge nearby, and a stream of tents and campers continued
from there all the way to Lambeth Bridge.

![](/assets/img/blog/2019/10/07/unnamed-min-2.jpg){:.img-fluid style="width:750px;"}
{:.text-center}

Despite the efforts of peacefully protesting rebels in London today,
pre-planned and persistent police confiscations have left blockades
lacking infrastructure and amenities. However, officers failed to
confiscate the rebel spirit, which lives on in furious love and
determination.

The Rebellion is alive and well. Join us in London!

### Paris -- "Occupation pour la suite du monde" -- April's boat crosses the channel

**7 OCT   \| 15:00 onwards   \| Place de Chatelet, Paris, France**

![](/assets/img/blog/2019/10/07/unnamed-1-min-2.jpg){:.img-fluid style="width:750px;"}
{:.text-center}

XR France managed to [block and occupy Paris' most central and busiest
intersection](https://extinctionrebellion.fr/evenements/2019/09/05/occupation-pour-la-suite-du-monde.html), near the Nôtre-Dame cathedral. Rebels, aware of the
sensitivity of the site, kept the location secret until the last minute
and attached themselves to flower planters to complicate police efforts
to remove them.

Rebels reminiscent of the now symbolic pink boat *Berta Cáceres* that
reigned over London's Oxford Circus during the last international
rebellion can be reassured -- its blue brother has crossed the channel
for this October and cast its anchor in Parisian waters.

As we are "all in the same boat", its DJs and dancers are inviting
passers-by to join this festive occupation in all of its creativity, and
keep the troops energized and regenerated for a lasting rebellion.

### Climate Camp Berlin

**7 OCT \| Berlin, Germany**

![](/assets/img/blog/2019/10/07/pasted%20image%200-4.jpg){:.img-fluid style="width:750px;"}
{:.text-center}

Our uprising begins. From early morning, 1000 rebels blocked the "Big
Star" roundabout surrounding Berlin's Siegessäule as well as a key
junction at Potsdamer Platz. As the sun rose, peaceful rebels danced and
sang.

Our ship, the Arche Rebella, has been put together once again in a new
location. "Captain" Carola Rackete stated the simple truth: "The
situation is more than severe: ecosystems and species are threatened by
the climate catastrophe and the actions of mankind. The planet and its
natural resources are our basis of life -- if it is not in balance, the
consequences will be catastrophic for the planet and for all of
humanity."

![](/assets/img/blog/2019/10/07/pasted%20image%200-5.jpg){:.img-fluid style="width:750px;"}
{:.text-center}

Berlin rebellion takes to the air!

3000 rebels held Potsdamer Platz -- with the help of lots of potted
plants and a Red Rebel Brigade --  and the site was buzzing. Rebels
continued to hold the Platz for longer than expected, with some chaining
themselves together.

Even as police threatened rebels with physical violence if they failed
to clear the blockade, our mood could not be beaten!  We were dancing,
singing and sending out a strong signal about the climate crisis.

It was early evening before police were able to begin slowly clearing
rebels. Two thousand rebels remained and the good mood continued as food
was shared, even as police began confiscating our equipment.

### Madrid -- Dia Uno

**7 OCT   \| Madrid, Spain**

![](/assets/img/blog/2019/10/07/jhbn.jpg){:.img-fluid style="width:750px;"}
{:.text-center}

Madrid rebels had a dramatic first day of Rebellion! 300 rebels
surrounded a pink boat to block a bridge and were greeted by an alarming
police response that included twisting arms, pressing thumbs into
rebels' eyes and putting pressure under their jaws. 10 rebels were
hospitalised and many others suffered minor injuries. There were 43
arrests that day in Madrid.

But their spirits were not broken. The rebels went onto cause further
disruption and set up camp in front of Spain's Ministry of Ecological
Transition. Rebels dressed in red, blue and brown -- representing forest
fires, rising sea levels and desertification -- stalked others dressed
in animal costumes in a striking performance about mass extinction.

### Amsterdam

**7 OCT   \| Amsterdam, The Netherlands**

![](/assets/img/blog/2019/10/07/unnamed-2-min.jpg){:.img-fluid style="width:750px;"}
{:.text-center}

Amsterdam rebelled against a ban imposed by the mayor and
police[](https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/extinction-rebellion-gaat-ondanks-verbod-toch-protesteren~b81d35e4/)and
brought non-violent direct action to the heart of the city. In the early
hours, eager rebels gathered to block off roads in front of the city's
famous museums.

In addition to beautiful paintings by Vermeer and Van Gogh, tourists
viewed a modern day decor of brave earth-protectors fighting for their
democracy and freedom of speech. The site then toured around the
Heineken Experience to make sure any tourists there didn't miss out.

In a miscalculated response, the police blocked off the first protest
site, playing into our rebels' hands, who staged an impromptu die-in on
the Dam square instead.

The protests ended in over 100 arrests with [rebels responding to police
aggression by collectively chanting '*We are peaceful, what are
you?*](https://www.facebook.com/ExtinctionRebellionNL/videos/497162334471282/)'

Four large city buses transported the arrestees away. Cries of peaceful
resistance and tunes from the busses echoed far and wide through the
capital's narrow streets and over the canals.

The first reports of[smiley rebels released from
custody](https://twitter.com/NLRebellion/status/1181210158724194305) are
already in! After a good night's sleep in the newly established rebel
town in front of the Rijksmusuem, Dutch rebels will bring back the
action tomorrow with a gathering at the Vondelpark.

### The Bull of Wall Street

** 7 OCT   \| New York, USA**

![](/assets/img/blog/2019/10/07/unnamed-5-min.jpg){:.img-fluid style="width:750px;"}
{:.text-center}

[Around 90](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/nyregion/extinction-rebellion-nyc-protest.html)
New Yorker rebels were arrested yesterday after they launched a wave of
actions in the city's famous financial district. Protesters poured fake
blood over Wall Street's iconic Bull statue, held a very bloody die-in
outside the New York stock exchange, and then blocked a nearby road.


The die-in was attended by the stunning Red Brigade, and featured a New
Orleans funeral band that got the hundreds of rebellious mourners
dancing in the streets. Tombstones mentioning hurricanes and fires made
worse by the climate crisis were held aloft, along with a coffin with
the words "Our future" written on the side. Once the fun was over,
rebels clean-up crews stepped in to mop the fake blood away.

Police set up a perimeter and arrested rebels in waves. Despite the high
arrest count, the sunkissed rebellion base in nearby Washington Square
park was buzzing. Actions will be continuing here over the coming days,
and are expected to spread to Chicago and Washington DC later in the
week.

### A new chapter for XR Canada

**7 OCT \| Toronto, Canada**

![](/assets/img/blog/2019/10/07/pasted%20image%200-6.jpg){:.img-fluid style="width:750px;"}
{:.text-center}

XR Toronto gathered at Playter Gardens in the city's east end for a day
of October Rebellion. After an early morning debriefing, protesters took
to the Bloor Viaduct with banners, signs, and megaphones, numbers
bolstered by other groups and allies.

There, they cordoned off the bridge and nearby Danforth Avenue from rush
hour traffic, allowing the space to play host to a multitude of
activities. In addition to activist speeches and performances, the group
participated in
[singing](https://twitter.com/XR_Toronto/status/1181232133534371841),
meditation and yoga sessions while other protestors chalked key messages
along the concrete.

Looming over the action were Extinction Rebellion banners and messages,
draped across the Viaduct walls, and the organization's iconic hourglass
logo set at an impressive height.

As the morning wore on, police announced a request for dispersal, yet
several rebels  remained. This group sat or stood in front of large, red
and yellow "Act Now" block letters while the rest of the protesters
swelled to either side of Danforth Avenue with songs of peace and hope.
Arrestees -- all nonviolent -- were eventually taken into police cars
and driven off; the remaining group returned to Playter Gardens for
camaraderie and regeneration.

Toronto's action upon the Viaduct reached a wide audience of receptive
hearts. Hard work is ahead but another river has undoubtedly been
crossed. With actions from Halifax to Victoria, today marked a new
chapter of XR's fight for climate justice in Canada.

### Aussie rebels bring the heat

**7 OCT \| Melbourne, Australia**

![](/assets/img/blog/2019/10/07/unnamed-3-min.jpg){:.img-fluid style="width:750px;"}
{:.text-center}

The day began with a sacred ceremony on the steps of Parliament House,
when rebels, still waking up, took gum leaves and received the welcome
via smoke cleansing before moving back to the central campsite of
Carlton Gardens.

Inside the gardens there were family events, talks, training sessions
and a choir. A massive Declaration of Rebellion was made against the
criminal inaction of the world's governments on the climate and
ecological emergency.

Upwards of a thousand people came together at 16:00 for a march through
the CBD (Central Business District), which was successfully disrupted
from 16:00 -- 19:00, in a colourful, energetic, peaceful, respectful
action. Some carried a glass coffin, like a fish tank, filled with
aquatic plants and rocks to illustrate concern for about the impact of
climate change on oceans.

![](/assets/img/blog/2019/10/07/unnamed-2-min.jpg){:.img-fluid style="width:750px;"}
{:.text-center}

The plan was to march through the city creating swarms in key
intersections as a taste of actions that will follow for the entire
week. The police had a strong presence, including mounted officers. At
least 10 rebels were arrested, sacrificing their liberty to draw
attention to the climate emergency and the need to act.

Extinction Rebellion Victoria acknowledges that Camp Carlton and the
Spring Rebellion take place on the stolen land of the Boon Wurrung and
Woiwurrung (Wurundjeri) peoples of the Kulin Nation. Sovereignty was
never ceded.

International Rebellion in XR Unchained. There is so much to tell.*

Excitingly, XR India and Sri Lanka held their first ever XR actions on
the 6th -- rebels acted with incredible heart and courage even amidst
possible police interference. Meanwhile in New Zealand, rebels blockaded
a crucial street outside the Ministry of Business, Innovation and
Employment with the iconic pink boat.

In Latin America, rebels turned out in Chile, Colombia, and Mexico to
call for immediate action from their governments. Brazilian rebels held
a die-in on Copacabana beach and XR Argentina held three different
rebellious actions in Buenos Aires.

Europe truly outdid itself this time, with creative actions happening
all over, including Athens, Vienna, Rome, Istanbul, and Moldova (to name
but a few).

Across the globe, rebels took to the streets with love and rage to call
upon their governments and politicians to   #ActNow to mitigate the
climate and ecological crisis. International Rebellion will continue
with even more brilliant events in the coming weeks.

Announcements

### Rebelling Remotely

We know that many of our readers who are unable to participate directly
in one of our big actions are still really keen to get involved. The
great news is that there are plenty of other ways in which you can make
a really valuable contribution, wherever you are.

**Volunteer for a support role with XR** -- [many can be done
remotely](https://rebellionroles.earth/remote-workers/), so you can
still take an active role even if you live a long way from the major
centres and protest sites. For example, this newsletter is put together
by people from all over the world -- if you think you could help with
the newsletter team, please fill in [this
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zMVBbTq1bwM9NexXnvLY3o-pNCAW5_M-wTWmFCTbTsM/edit#responses).

**Raise local awareness** -- we need people to understand why we're
taking action and why they should join or support us. The easiest way to
do this is simply discussing it with family, friends, neighbours and
colleagues. You could also hand out leaflets and talk to people in your
local area, organise a "Heading for Extinction" talk, or even [form a
local
group](https://rebellion.earth/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/How-to-start-a-local-Extinction-Rebellion-group.pdf)!

**Make a donation** -- you can donate money to support our activities
[through our website](https://chuffed.org/project/xrinternational). You can also
contribute to groups in many different ways, such as helping out
with printing or providing a meeting space. In some locations, supplies
and equipment are being confiscated in an effort to stop our protests --
by providing replacement items you can help them continue.

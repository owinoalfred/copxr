A time of crises: C-19 and the Climate and Ecological Breakdown. Read how rebels are adapting to difficult times and see our list of announcements to get involved. 
{:.huge .text-center}  

![Rebel with a Corona Facemask](/assets/uploads/newsletter-38-image1.jpg "Rebel with a Corona Facemask")

Dear rebels,

We hope you’re keeping well in these strange times. It’s been a difficult month for many of us, with Covid-19 dominating the global conversation. 

Perhaps the most difficult aspect of C-19 is the struggle to live in this new world of distancing and isolation. It’s important to remember then, that we are in this together, as a movement and a species. There is a humility in the way  Covid unites us all - regardless of country, creed or colour. In this at least, it parallels the Climate and Ecological crisis. 

Read on to see how rebels are evolving to the situation: with [Global Support](https://rebellion.global/) launching the ‘Love & Rage in Times of Corona’ campaign, and [AloneTogether](https://rebellion.earth/2020/03/23/alonetogether-regenerative-rebellion-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/) in the UK - there are more ways than ever to stay involved and connected. 

This month we also [celebrate Earth Day](https://www.letterstotheearth.com/press?link_id=24&can_id=5fc72a357d20eb650a9390877d889f30&source=email-inside-xr-uk-25&email_referrer=email_768462&email_subject=inside-xr-uk-25), and look back at the [anniversary of our first International Rebellion](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelmX6EbqvGWq8GmT-WRtW-ieGPRuJTT16Zx4dPwQ7LOcwc9g/viewform). We are struck by how different life is twelve months later, as we face not one, but two global crises, yet we find hope in the response, as communities come together to share and support each other.

Also in this issue, we take a look at [XR NYC’s April Fool’s](https://twitter.com/XR_NYC/status/1245380662770663425) event and catch up with [dancing rebels in Italy](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=319510132343160). There’s good news from the [Standing Rock](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/climate/dakota-access-pipeline-sioux.html), and a beautiful ‘Exploring XR’ piece from [rebels in Uganda](https://twitter.com/XREA15) braving the law to stand up for the Earth.

Finally, we introduce a new element to the global newsletter: ‘Pandemic Picks’ invites you to get into the quarantine routine with a carefully crafted list of inspiring books, films and tunes chosen by your very own newsletter team. Send us your suggestions. 

Until next month, stay safe rebels. Stay brave.

## Action Highlights

### C-19 & the Climate and Ecological Crisis

**Ongoing \| Worldwide**

In order to save lives, people around the world are enacting personal distancing measures. Airlines in Europe have reduced flights by [75% to 85%](https://www.irishnews.com/business/2020/03/17/news/europe-s-airlines-prepare-to-ground-fleets-as-coronavirus-cripples-aviation-industry-1869363/); global long-haul airlines have cut flights by up to [96%](https://www.irishnews.com/business/2020/03/17/news/europe-s-airlines-prepare-to-ground-fleets-as-coronavirus-cripples-aviation-industry-1869363/). Almost every cruise line has paused operation until [April, May, or even 2021](https://www.cruisecritic.com.au/news/5206/).

Global in-city travel has also dropped drastically, [up to 97%](https://citymapper.com/cmi) as of 26 March. People aren’t driving to work or to shops. Many public transit systems have also reduced or halted services.

This halt in travel will save people from becoming infected with Covid-19. **It also provides us with a preview of what our planet could look like with drastic emissions reduction.** [China’s 25% reduction in emissions in February](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/16/asia/china-pollution-coronavirus-hnk-intl/index.html) was the equivalent of a half-year of emissions for the UK. [Air pollution in the UK](https://phys.org/news/2020-03-pollution-uk-cities-coronavirus-impacts.html) is lower than the previous 5 years average after the lockdown was implemented.

### Will Pollution Come Back When Covid-19 Is Conquered?

When countries stimulate their economies after a crisis, the emissions that result can destroy all the climate gains made by the slow period. This happened [in China in 2009](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/16/asia/china-pollution-coronavirus-hnk-intl/index.html) after the global economic crash. When COVID-19 is behind us, **let’s find ways to continue these reductions and mitigate the damage of climate change**.

### Funding Fools

**1 APRIL \| Online** 

Playing a cool double bluff,  [XR New York City](https://twitter.com/XR_NYC) rebels masquerading as Google released an online statement declaring that in lieu of their normal [April Fools joke](https://agreenergoogle.com), the multinational tech giant would stop funding climate denial.”  

![XR google prank](/assets/uploads/newsletter-38-image4.jpg)

The mock website featured Google style graphics and links to genuine articles substantiating Google’s role in spreading climate misinformation. 

An apology was issued for ‘putting profit over the planet’ followed by a pledge to push a ‘zero tolerance policy for climate change denial among our partners.’  

In the light of the **Covid-19 pandemic**, the idealised ‘Google’ also acknowledged how ignoring [science](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-3/) can result in suffering on a global scale.    

Finally, they suggested joining [Extinction Rebellion](https://rebellion.global) to become part of the solution.

### Standing Rock Legal Victory

**25 March \| North Dakota, USA**

An environmental battle which gripped the world’s attention back in 2016 was [reignited](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/climate/dakota-access-pipeline-sioux.html) last week, when a federal judge ordered a fresh review of the Dakota Access Pipeline. 

**The [Standing Rock Sioux Tribe](https://www.standingrock.org/) have won a significant legal battle** for a fresh environmental review of the pipeline, which began moving oil through their territory, and crucially under the sacred Lake Oahe in 2017.

![Flags fly at the Oceti Sakowin Camp near Cannonball, North Dakota](/assets/uploads/newsletter-38-image5.jpg)

*Flags fly at the Oceti Sakowin Camp near Cannonball, North Dakota. Photo: Lucas Zhao*

A bitter contest has raged between thousands of indigenous activists and allies with police over the pipeline. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe are worried that a spill would **pollute water** they rely on for fishing, drinking and religious ceremonies. 

[Back in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Access_Pipeline_protests), youth from Standing Rock and surrounding Native American communities stopped the construction of the pipeline by [occupying the site and organising mass protests](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/north-dakota-access-oil-pipeline-protests-explainer). As camps and public outrage grew, the Obama administration announced that the Army Corps of Engineers would need to seek alternate routes. 

 But just four days into office, Trump approved the construction of the pipeline ..

In his ruling, the Washington Federal Judge stated that “too many questions remain unanswered” over the impact of the pipeline on communities in the area, and that the unreviewed environmental effects are “highly controversial.” 

The Sioux Tribe and Earthjustice, who represent them in court, have [hailed the decision](https://www.ncronline.org/news/earthbeat/standing-rock-sioux-celebrate-significant-legal-win-dapl-fight) as a “significant legal win” and their attorney said that **the tribe will be seeking to shut down the pipeline while reviews are carried out**.

### Beautiful Balconies Over Dark Depths

**20 MAR \| Italy**

![Rebel Discobedience on the balcony](/assets/uploads/newsletter-38-image6.jpg)

Isolated rebels across Italy have found some light in the darkness by turning their balconies into dance floors and staging a synchronised [discobedience](https://www.facebook.com/XRTorino/videos/319510132343160/). 

[XR Italy](https://extinctionrebellion.it/) teamed up with [Fridays For Future Italia](https://www.facebook.com/FridaysItalia/) to organise the **balcony boogie**, and the two groups are planning more Friday actions as the nationwide quarantine continues.

Italy has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Throughout this crisis, XR Italy has remained highly active online and is now welcoming a surge of new recruits.

In just one week, their online induction meetings have drawn interest from over a **thousand people**, and every 50 person session they schedule gets booked up within the hour. 

Asked what might have caused this surge in interest, a coordinator in Rome felt the lockdown had given many people the **time to reflect** on larger social issues like the environment and our consumerist culture, and how these link to public health.

There is a growing awareness in Italy that [this pandemic is being linked to man’s exploitation of nature](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/8/3888) and that destroying animals and their habitats may [have paved the way for this virus to move to human hosts](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00923-8).

Even with [scientific opinion](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/opinion/coronavirus-pandemics.html) behind them, XR Italy realises this is a difficult message that needs to be delivered with delicacy. Italy is in the midst of a true tragedy. Over fifteen thousand have died, and social distancing guidelines make traditional funerals impossible.

In a country ready for systemic change, Italian rebels are determined to start a vital conversation with their fellow citizens.

### XR Uganda: Be For Mother Earth, So She Can Be For You

**Uganda** 

![Extinction Rebellion Uganda](/assets/uploads/newsletter-38-image8.jpg)

*XR Uganda setting off to Mbale district Eastern Uganda to mark International Women’s Day*

[XR Uganda](https://twitter.com/XREA15) was founded by a teacher in 2019, and its numbers have been steadily growing ever since. 

The Ugandan rebel we spoke to, an IT professional, was the second person to join the group.  “I was researching the shocking number of [suicides](https://www.globalcitizen.org/es/content/climate-change-is-driving-farmers-in-india-to-comm/) by Indian farmers whose crops had failed as a result of climate change. I came across the XR website and thought, **let me sign up and be a part of this team**.”

Uganda has been radically altered by climate change. Temperatures are [rising](https://www.independent.co.ug/climate-change-east-africa-faces-2c-rise-in-temperature/). Groundwater is [disappearing](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-environment-water/as-water-bank-runs-dry-uganda-greens-hills-to-soak-up-rain-idUSKCN1LT1IZ). In some regions, spring wells and village [boreholes](https://climatecare.org/project/boreholes-in-uganda/) have dried up completely.  

Lack of rain has brought [drought](https://www.independent.co.ug/3-5-million-ugandans-face-starvation/), with [unpredictable seasons](https://www.pmldaily.com/news/2019/06/unpredictable-weather-worries-farmers-as-food-insecurity-looms-in-uganda.html) leading to shifts in planting patterns. Floods and landslides, [caused](https://blogs.agu.org/landslideblog/2018/10/12/bududa-1/) by deforestation, degradation of wetlands, and poor farming methods, have resulted in forced migration across Uganda. The country already hosts the largest amount of [refugees](https://humanitariancompendium.iom.int/appeals/uganda-2019) in Africa.   

![XR Uganda Children](/assets/uploads/newsletter-38-image9.jpg)

*XR Uganda Children*

**XR Uganda is considered illegal** as it isn’t registered as a community based organisation, NGO or business. Rebels believe the authorities fear that the movement will sponsor individuals to stand against the ruling political party. 

But the Ugandan rebels remain optimistic. They are taking their message to communities and schools, engaging children while demanding access to **quality education for all** and highlighting how the climate breakdown has a **disproportionate** impact on [women](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2020/03/08/power-structures-gender-make-women-vulnerable-climate-change/).  

The message from our rebel contact is clear: “XR Uganda is rising up - [watch this space!](https://twitter.com/XREA15)”

**By 12 April \| Online**

Whether it’s for our key workers or neighbours, our family or ourselves - letters of love, support  and hope are needed. These letters are for you to keep, give (safely), put up in your window, or share on social media using #LetterstotheEarth.

Please send a copy of your letters, in any language, to [letterstotheearth@gmail.com](mailto:letterstotheearth@gmail.com) by **12th April.** A selection will be performed by a global community of readers by  live stream on Earth Day, 22nd April.

## Pandemic Picks #2: Neither Wolf Nor Dog

**Feature \| UK/USA \| Dir. Steven Lewis Simpson**

![Neither Wolf Nor Dog](/assets/uploads/newsletter-38-image20.jpg)

*Kent Nerburn (Christopher Sweeney) receives an offer he can't refuse.* 

As the trappings of his modern life fall away, he becomes immersed in the physical and spiritual heart of the Dakota plains, their contemporary Native American people and a tragic, shameful history. This history remains as relevant today in light of the continued persecution of Indigenous people all over the world.   

*Neither Wolf Nor Dog* is a Kickstarter funded, independent film shot by the smallest of crews.  It is beautiful, often funny and at its heart is Lakota elder Dan (95 year-old Dave Bald Eagle), whose final, improvised speech at the site of the Wounded Knee massacre is both raw and deeply moving.

## Humans of XR

![Lesley Morrison, Doctors for XR](/assets/uploads/newsletter-38-image21.jpg)

**Lesley Morrison, Doctors for XR** 

“We are only as safe as our most vulnerable. The poor suffer most in both crises and we urgently need to address **health and social inequalities**. Global challenges need systemic change.

Neither Covid nor climate pay attention to borders, the world is a small place, and we're all interconnected. This is the basis of planetary health. **Prevention is better than cure**. 

The role and crucial importance of scientific expertise needs to be, and has been, recognised. The cynicism and disregard for scientific expertise promoted by populist politicians has hopefully lost credibility. People are learning to trust and to value health and science professionals.”

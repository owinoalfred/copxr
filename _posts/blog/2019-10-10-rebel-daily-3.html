October 10, 2019 by Extinction Rebellion

<p><strong>Empathy begins at home.</strong>&nbsp;Many of those reading this will, in the past days and months, have fought, grafted and struggled to build&nbsp;<strong>spaces where human beings can come together, support one another in a shared sense of loving grief</strong>. Grief for the damage we see all around us;&nbsp;<strong>grief for the future we fear for our children or ourselves</strong>.</p>

<p>For many, it’s only by means of this hard-won togetherness that our eyes can be opened to another harsh truth: that&nbsp;<strong>the emergency is not a future prospect, but is in fact&nbsp;<a href="http://www.resumenlatinoamericano.org/2019/10/09/argentina-mujeres-originarias-ocupan-ministerio-del-interior-no-nos-vamos-a-ir-hasta-que-nos-reciba-el-ministro-nos-estan-violando-nos-estan-matando-fotosvideos-comunicado-la-rebelio/?fbclid=IwAR3Kf5kufawQIm6ZLAyGBN_Ud5OZYEd4oSG94E_kZmHNEux6X2XBPgRLYYE">a fact of life</a>&nbsp;for countless people and communities around the world, and has been for decades.</strong></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Z8LyQGwvQ0dGUJlI18poNvnWPH8t_6kpbxnaE4i9MyNLWLylUu_XkSQDFzN_fvP9O_xBqTbNqM_bX1JV9T-um62AgErc9G9BpSnNuXSqUfoxJbGcbv2zVXrNx8BG46_f-HZ4PqG5" alt=""></figure>

<p>With their own conditions stable for now,&nbsp;<strong>XR communities in Paris and London joined in a wave of solidarity for fallen Earth Defenders: those for whom standing up for life and for the natural world has meant death.&nbsp;</strong>The idea of this supportive wave came from<strong>&nbsp;XR&nbsp;</strong><strong>Argentina</strong>, but was taken up as far away as&nbsp;<strong>Dublin</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Cape Town</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Islamabad</strong>.</p>

<p>Empathy begins at home –&nbsp;<strong>but it doesn’t end there</strong>. It takes us&nbsp;<strong>beyond borders, beyond divisions, to a greater understanding of the immensity of what’s at stake</strong>.</p>

<p>We must follow it:&nbsp;<strong>it’s only with a global, collective moment of awakening that we can hope to face this crisis.</strong></p>

<h3><a>Action Highlights</a> &nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Day of the Defenders</h3>

<p><strong>9 OCT | Buenos Aires, Santiago, Islamabad, Dublin, Cape Town, London</strong></p>

<p><strong>Last year, 164 activists were killed in the Global South for trying to defend their lands from corporate extractivism.</strong>&nbsp;Yesterday, rebels all over the world held vigils to honour them,&nbsp;<strong>coming together in a global solidarity action</strong>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QjyEmn2dM2urlwNxAZd7eM2noakGuLJePt5XHyT_IIsBPUdQ_FUqg4wv761W28-TY5zXl5LdbtHUCXP4QgVfsSfuPA_0V2JtLJfAnpHOo5KHMbDkOkMXC8ebZoHIUFTp0xirPgls" alt=""></figure>

<p>In&nbsp;<strong>Buenos Aires</strong>, a large group walked to the UN building, each member dressed in black, holding a candle, and&nbsp;<strong>carrying a sign bearing the name of one of the 164 murdered activists</strong>.</p>

<p>They read out a statement and&nbsp;<strong>knelt on the pavement to write the names of the fallen activists on the ground in chalk</strong>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xpJfHQuQE8fI2sB_qa2xhIoflTS_yTGJIvG0i6VGFAEaEy69xKDTDOIfUIH3WqvaHyfULwiwJMCcr4EoQseTLkxExMlNrMwUR5y6GFS5-sChNN_2NIIoLBjUcO-d-JvXXjSD2i7N" alt=""></figure>

<p>In&nbsp;<strong>Santiago</strong>, rebels took part in<strong>&nbsp;a solemn procession</strong>&nbsp;which brought them to the main historical square Plaza de Armas. They held a&nbsp;<strong>vigil to commemorate the 164</strong>, first by&nbsp;<strong>speaking out every name in turn</strong>&nbsp;and then by&nbsp;<strong>observing a minute’s silence</strong>&nbsp;in which to contemplate the incredible sacrifice that had been made.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<strong>Islamabad</strong>, rebels silently constructed a gallows outside the National Press Club and staged the hanging of two rebels who stood precariously on blocks of ice. Behind them stood a large&nbsp;<strong>sign listing the names of the 164</strong>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jkLCnGARZZzFDH7qCch93wFIRQqaF1RLMn1easJU8vVtNn5YJ4810OwzEZGe-fWVcftbdQLO-QSVtyhtcI82jZsJW7d_sDZILHxegKNGlkPHVFbA2GuQoPui1WKKe4Mr6FaGNOT3" alt=""></figure>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>Dublin</strong>, rebels knelt outside the main gates of the Coal Marketing Company with their&nbsp;<strong>hands covered in fake blood</strong>. CMC has coordinated the sale and delivery of&nbsp;<strong>over 450 million tonnes of coal from Cerrejón</strong>, a vast open-pit coal mine in Colombia.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<strong>Cape Town</strong>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJACyo0UFIQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">a solemn street vigil was held</a>&nbsp;where rebels listened to speeches and stood to remember those who gave their lives.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<strong>London</strong>, 164 rebels held a procession ending in a die-in at Trafalgar Square, the name-bearing signs resting on their bodies.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Px1wu-PzQUndnTLwMYQmneEZ0hAlOIBukitF7hXW8pU1odL5B7czF8xjB9y2dLjRDTNnsxtcZc7EedHO5RFvyObZmDuq_pbAv8zkXNZipttmgzB3SPaoR1wMg_4XZj8SzWMTwpuf" alt=""></figure>

<p>The figure of&nbsp;<strong>164 deaths</strong>&nbsp;is only an estimate.&nbsp;<strong>The real figure is likely to be much higher.&nbsp;</strong>Two indigenous activists are murdered every week for defending their lands from Western extractivist corporations, and<strong>&nbsp;their names are rarely known</strong>&nbsp;<strong>widely</strong>&nbsp;around the world.</p>

<p><strong>Today at least, the fallen defenders were remembered all around the planet they fought to save.</strong></p>

<h3>Four Bridges and a Die-in</h3>

<p><strong>9 OCT | Berlin, Germany</strong></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/a0zIy_abr_AhQdRpY76_8-016BQsVjFldJx_rut60E1FNlw7Iu0fofMVFnP-PQazqVRHDBM6rNDxw00pm_IzJr4eOc14Ru70xXzAhPJcCYmUASrBIysIDGEw9bUHXMrZ6b5A5Nu0" alt=""></figure>

<p><strong>Day three of Berlin’s Rebellion saw an old blockade fall but many new ones spring up to take its place.</strong></p>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Big Star</strong>&nbsp;roundabout blockade, XR Berlin’s longest standing act of disruption, was finally cleared out yesterday.&nbsp;<strong>Rebels made sure to leave the area spotless</strong>, with only defiant chalk graffiti remaining as the&nbsp;<strong>traffic returned after a 58-hour break</strong>.</p>

<p>But by the early hours of the morning,&nbsp;<strong>300 rebels had already blocked the Marschallbrücke bridge beside the Reichstag, locking onto a giant wooden life raft.</strong></p>

<p>And to the East,&nbsp;<strong>a serious blockade had begun on the four-lane Mühlendammbrücke bridge</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>1,500 rebels&nbsp;</strong>turned up just in time for the rush-hour traffic. It took until the afternoon for the police to clear what was a particularly high-energy yet peaceful demonstration.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VSe0cOPKJYM7khtgpApRwiE1zCiUvYT9dcYrP35O_6t8pdQ8EsdFs86nsW8L_rRRmso32O5Wj6WkYiYeM7_yTvICaXkZqc2524ZMtrmPJwCahbMy6JSEGzfQ3tSorycqbBFBCyHB" alt=""></figure>

<p>Not content with blockading two major bridges, rebels<strong>&nbsp;set upon taking two more</strong>, and traffic in the city centre was brought to a near standstill. There was also&nbsp;<strong>a die-in outside the Chancellery</strong>, Angela Merkel’s office, for good measure.</p>



<p>To top off a big day,&nbsp;<strong>XR Youth blockaded a major junction in the busy shopping zone of Kurfurstendamm</strong>, demanding an end to business-as-usual and rampant consumerism. For the many shoppers passing through, the message will have been hard to miss.</p>



<h3>London</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/htkXj1-BV5D4VE2C7pygDlS_-YKU_f2M2Ic4Cqb6qbB0qpiELAe-biZ9_oifV68sFO7-HWyeycZL-1nfuJ9XCCYfI-Zuty000YHgbjvLRudLiu1i1Hp1aDympWMxNOwYmmTSNgWj" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>In a grim metaphor for the ongoing extermination and extinction of so much of our planet’s natural life</strong>, the police are picking rebels off the street with steady assurance –&nbsp;<strong>92 year-olds and&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/police-kettle-giant-pink-octopus-march-trafalgar-square-10889223/">Pink Octopi</a></strong>&nbsp;alike have been removed.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Authorities act in accordance with&nbsp;<strong>laws designed not to protect the wellbeing of citizens, but to uphold power and protect an insatiable growth-based status quo</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Arrests</strong>&nbsp;in this rebellion (over 600 and counting) were very much expected.&nbsp;<strong>More of a shock is the police tactic of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2464175430481370">forcefully confiscating</a>&nbsp;shelter, food and water, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=536601430502010&amp;id=401847960644025">anything that might allow disabled people to conveniently participate</a>.</strong></p>



<p>In its eagerness to drown out our message of bad news, the government seems happy to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2464175430481370">give up its duty of care</a>, and in doing so threaten the paramount right to protest.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/M1BKM4ye37fkOban4RlEJBpCgvBuJarMMtl0A4U4mveZeVQnXKEOuDlJlF-gvKZyXHGUn5JF5FC4l_9cv8Q_llJD6QZhCh4mbWwHjYv3sjvuwnKTn_pUdhZDHMETl4tmqawJhaTA" alt=""><figcaption> <em>A wheelchair…really?</em> </figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite this treatment, rebels have&nbsp;<strong>risen magnificently to the occasion and continue to show profound resilience and courage.</strong></p>



<p>Day 3 saw<strong>&nbsp;a litany of creative, democratic, informed, inclusive and visionary outpourings of the rebellious spirit</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAIIC_pHSA&amp;feature=youtu.be">mothers nursed their infants</a>,&nbsp;<strong>Youth</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Elders</strong>&nbsp;came together for a theatrical ‘die in’, Gail Bradbrook and Geroge Monbiot spoke, and we have&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://actionnetwork.org/forms/keep-it-grounded-city-airport?source=direct_link&amp;">big plans for City Airport</a>&nbsp;today</strong>.</p>



<p>The PM’s dad is certainly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49987567">impressed</a>, and Benedict Cumberbatch joined us for the night. But most significantly,&nbsp;<strong>over 400 MPs came to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/extinctionrebellionnorth/videos/718607281885037/">collect a young tree to plant</a>&nbsp;from us</strong>. ‘[Extinction Rebellion] has changed the conversation’, claims Ed Miliband.</p>



<p><strong>And we’re going to keep changing it. Whatever it takes.</strong></p>



<p><em>Please come along to our&nbsp;unifying&nbsp;<strong>march on Saturday</strong> as we gather to express our&nbsp;grief&nbsp;for the loss of life on our planet. <strong>Beginning in St James Park at 1.30pm</strong> and ending in Russell&nbsp;Square.</em></p>

<h3>Broadening perspectives in Paris</h3>



<p><strong>09 OCT | Place de Chatelet and beyond, Paris, France</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EPS7IfupAzO0FYC4ApSittSurhgHU-ebCDy8PxzNTJcla3gUfIncEhAMIUD3fo_hGEiw5V-PPohulkbLvnYv9HdQQk6d3kPHPAf4AWO_Cq_xqhcJ12nxEbwv_2m-eDG3RoXo759B" alt=""></figure>



<p>Still&nbsp;<strong>no arrests</strong>&nbsp;in Paris today. Rebels from the&nbsp;<strong>Place de Chatelet&nbsp;</strong>tried to tickle the police and expand their area onto the busy Rue de Rivoli, block the private spaces of a nearby McDonalds and Louis Vuitton shop – but&nbsp;<strong>nothing prompted a police response</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fFILThp4QBSEvkCFWrdNV4LyqZhbrtsRDWe8Lbd9jLTqymQ7wd8BG2OJpUaVkvwlz0T0qikEiD4F1aD7qNcpKcmUTFDLB3lm6AX-WbsgHFWHnJTkMvwE_ivNSAMNhIYtfLIpYi50" alt=""></figure>



<p>Beyond actions, the day was one of reflection and horizon-expanding.</p>



<p>We had a visit from&nbsp;<strong>two indigenous activists from Cauca in Colombia, María and Samuel</strong>. They thanked French rebels for joining the struggle for Mother Nature and encouraged them to continue, but reminded us that<strong>&nbsp;their activist struggle back home is not only for Nature but for their communities and lives.</strong></p>



<p>According to Samuel, in the past month,&nbsp;<strong>47 indigenous</strong>&nbsp;representatives or guards have been killed in the Cauca region alone.&nbsp;<strong>Every day there is a rebellion, and the question of life or death is an ever-present concern.&nbsp;</strong>Our day ended with a tribute and silent procession.</p>



<p><strong>The environmental revolution will be built on solidarity and intercultural bonds, or it will not be built at all.</strong></p>

<h3>Chile calls for change</h3>



<p><strong>6- 8 OCT | Santiago, Chile</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kIe1fogUO6AreD6-lDz-pvXunL2556zKOMgKQg3rOBCYvUcxXupcjeyrDx6EIGInMAC54RB0RBpOnBgy7jvrAFf_fWXrk_5Nv0HLcx1utBu-rX3g9qYAiZweoLo-JQVaoC5ip5-z" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>Rebels in Santiago have been standing up and lying down in defense of the planet</strong>.</p>



<p>Chilean rebels held<strong>&nbsp;a family friendly die-in at Persa Bío Bío</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>a blockade at Alameda Av</strong>., one of the busiest streets of the city, and&nbsp;<strong>a protest against the fast fashion industry</strong>&nbsp;in Costanera Centre Mall.</p>



<p>On Saturday 12th, there will be a march on<strong>&nbsp;“El día del Encuentro de Dos Mundos” [Two Worlds Meeting),</strong>&nbsp;the remembrance day of Christopher Columbus arriving in America in 1492.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rebels will be there to ensure that the accompanying legacy of colonialism, genocide and ecocide is not forgotten.</strong></p>



<h3>South Africa Toxic Gas at Oil &amp; Power Conference</h3>



<p><strong>9 OCT | Cape Town, South Africa</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/UfB7S0YQ-w2ffesMD9tZf4q_X3vnBIh7dBPsRbAIO_YYlQYRIxgYWagW-iqazv6YR5l4fbbM61t4q79uV-pH3ZpdrFATFJnbmX0LvQcJjN4GRFuTNsfc67kVDJDu1EGcH_O_-DfF" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>XR Cape Town</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>XR Winelands</strong>&nbsp;took non-violent direct action yesterday against the&nbsp;<strong>‘Africa Oil and Power’ conference.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The die-in performance involved rebels suffocating in vibrant clouds of ‘toxic’ gas</strong>, and was staged to draw attention to the crimes against humanity and the ecocide that the conference is facilitating.</p>



<p>On its&nbsp;<a href="https://africaoilandpower.com/event/aop-2019/">website</a>&nbsp;the conference boasts of being a “platform” for countries across Africa to present&nbsp;<strong>oil exploration and other fossil fuel projects</strong>&nbsp;and “get deals signed”.&nbsp;<strong>No mention is made of the suffering stored up for the world’s most vulnerable with each new project undertaken.</strong></p>



<p>These omissions are especially conspicuous given the&nbsp;<strong>susceptibility of sub-Saharan Africa to climate breakdown</strong>, a topic that South Africa’s government and media has resolutely failed to tackle.&nbsp;<strong>This is still a landscape where new gas finds are celebrated and talk of ‘clean coal’ is left unquestioned.</strong></p>



<h3>XR Quebec Party for the Planet</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UKGkgYxKPnxBn9QGl-f-Dp2zRzb6d6t-iJ_QbkLx1_1ADv53wP36eG-wO8qTGVAHsGiqpUCWeBKIc6MfP2ewER2nZ6v4IX2mxfhrGff_pCMNuw41eKs9Sq7sbNrkjPaof79ppKkm" alt=""></figure>



<p>The IPCC report, published on 8th October 2018, was supposed to mark a ‘line in the sand’ on climate action.</p>



<p><strong>A year later, XR Quebec organized a birthday party</strong>&nbsp;on a busy intersection in the heart of downtown to highlight how government inaction had crossed that very line. And what a party it was!&nbsp;<strong>200 people came together for a celebration of life and rebellion</strong>, with vegan cake, XR birthday hats and live music!</p>



<p>But the symbolism didn’t end there: the original report was&nbsp;<strong>brought together by 40 countries</strong>, and it happened that&nbsp;<strong>40 rebels were arrested</strong>&nbsp;because they refused to end the party when told.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>arrestable support team</strong>&nbsp;didn’t miss a beat, providing&nbsp;<strong>pillows, legal advice and healthy snacks to the brave rebels!</strong></p>



<h3>XR Australia</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/a05wuBVVARIlhe8cBhjq9BIXQNIN-HRz7fmSZEQ5pRAmC-eAq5Ghcfshc7l0q5k6-j_EjdCJm__BDBV9JYCG2Duc217W3npj_Z9d3uzQ4Qp6pJgPFzrKxBdtqPrRswb0NMB660SM" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>At least 148 rebels have been arrested in Australia&nbsp;</strong>since the start of the Spring Rebellion.<a href="https://ausrebellion.earth/local-groups/">&nbsp;48 XR groups</a>&nbsp;are taking part in non-violent direct action across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rebels are committed to disrupt until their government listens and acts! &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In&nbsp;<strong>Melbourne</strong>, rebels held a silent vigil on the steps of state parliament before marching through the city, blocking Flinders Street, before being forcibly removed by police. On Wednesday, a<a href="https://www.facebook.com/XRAustralia/videos/502154847303219/">&nbsp;civil DISCO-Bedience</a>&nbsp;took place with rebels of all ages getting funky.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/CAdw0laJjF7p-uxjjslPHEWn087n0HjRBcYPBkXx5r9Dv0oPu6iAQLvhaA8lH28nqIwc7nRwMsdCUL9jbHcwlJzta82NOZvdTYPmrVmihNzEpYSYmSEJ5qHJq8rITWH0lVkVYIrF" alt=""></figure>



<p>On Wednesday,&nbsp;<strong>Tasmania</strong>&nbsp;ramped up actions with a<a href="https://www.facebook.com/XRAustralia/videos/419867922033746/?eid=ARBjJqtqLTtzNlHhlDK1XQqbtxAY2bVTxiRDLUx9xXJmLsBhGTxeariObKztI2ZNmWatEogPyGE5vmEA">&nbsp;Funeral for Life in Nipaluna / Hobart</a>&nbsp;to represent the generations that won’t exist because of inaction on climate change.</p>



<p>In an<a href="https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/blog/sydneys-rebellion-heats-up-an-interview-with-extinction-rebellions-elly-baxter/?fbclid=IwAR2jq6GqS_ramBsvzcRFm7XR77xp78WlnJT3FCB6TYlLOBqWZQv4g_c2oO8">&nbsp;interview</a>, Elly Baxter mentioned: “The cornerstone of democracy is the right to protest. The government is supposed to report to us, the people. At the moment, they’re reporting to&nbsp;<strong>fossil fuel companies</strong>, and vested interests. And it’s not good enough”.</p>

<p>‘<strong>We need workers eventually to take industrial strike action</strong>, that’s why there’s XR trades unionists meeting here on the 12th October. That will be the next big step, when ordinary organised workers actually take on board the slogan&nbsp;<strong>‘A living wage on a liveable planet’.</strong></p>



<p><strong>I’m not an Arrestable today because I am a person of colour, and I have a bit of an antagonistic relationship with the police.&nbsp;</strong>I’d loath to do a nice chit-chat with the Police, I’ll leave that to the white rebels who are backing me.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>It’s fantastic that here in London they’ve got&nbsp;<strong>climate refugees from the global south</strong>&nbsp;at the centre of their arguments, because it is&nbsp;<strong>people of colour that are impacted adversely</strong>.’</p>

**Earth, November 18** - Hundreds of XR  rebels in 27 countries on six continents went on hunger strike today to demand governments take immediate action to end the climate and ecological emergency.

  

**WHAT:** More than 400 hunger strikers with Extinction Rebellion are demanding governments enact Extinction Rebellion’s [three demands](https://rebellion.global/our-demands/). They want to highlight the devastating impact that the climate and ecological emergency is already having on global food supplies.

  

**WHEN:** November 18 to November 25

  

**WHERE:** Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Ecuador, France, Germany, Ghana, Holland, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States.

  

**WHY:** Time has almost run out to address the ecological crisis, which includes the 6th mass species extinction, global pollution, and abrupt, runaway climate change. Scientists and other experts see societal collapse and mass death as inevitable, with human extinction a possibility, unless rapid action is taken.

  

**WHO:** [Extinction Rebellion](https://rebellion.global/) believes it is a citizen’s duty to rebel, using peaceful civil disobedience, when faced with criminal inactivity by their Government. Extinction Rebellion’s key demands are:

1.  Government must tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency, working with other institutions to communicate the urgency for change.
    
2.  Government must act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.
    
3.  Government must create and be led by the decisions of a Citizens’ Assembly on climate and ecological justice.

![Crop Circle in the shape of the Extinction Rebellion symbol](/assets/uploads/UnchianedImage18.jpg)

‚ÄúToday, a circle in rapeseed with our logo of an hourglass appeared near Brno.

Rapeseed requires a high degree of chemicals, which are lethal to bees, and the herbicides used end up in groundwater.‚Äù

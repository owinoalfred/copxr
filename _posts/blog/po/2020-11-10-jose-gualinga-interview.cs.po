"José Gualinga is a leader of the Native People of Sarayaku, an indigenous "
"Kichwa group with 1400 inhabitants living in a remote part of Ecuador’s "
"southern Amazon. Known for their defence of the rights of nature and "
"indigenous peoples, the Sarayaku call themselves the People of Noon, "
"referring to an ancient prophecy of their ancestors claiming that they would "
"be a pillar of resistance after other communities had surrendered, a beacon "
"of light as strong as the midday sun."

"In 2012, the Sarayaku won a historic victory at the Inter-American Court of "
"Human Rights, which found that the Ecuadorian State had violated their "
"rights by allowing an oil company to prospect in their territory without "
"consultation. A turning point in the case was when José’s father, Don Sabino "
"Gualinga, the spiritual leader of Sarayaku and their most eminent yachak "
"(shaman), then aged 92, took the witness stand. He was asked about the "
"impact of the 1,433 kilograms of explosives that had been planted in "
"Sarayaku territory by the oil company, accompanied by armed military "
"personnel. Referring to the invisible beings that had been disturbed by the "
"explosions, Don Sabino said that “half of the lords of the jungle are no "
"longer there”."

"of France, François Hollande, in 2015, and to the Ecuadorian Government in "
"2018. The Sarayaku have also launched a professional football team to spread "
"the word about oil exploitation in the Amazon; sailed a canoe down the "
"Seine; and created a documentary, Children of the Jaguar, which won Best "

"Personally, I had a fortunate escape from the flood. On March 17 of this "
"year, just when the Health Emergency measures were issued, a torrential rain "
"had fallen on the headwaters of the Bobonaza River. That day, I was due to "
"travel to Sarayaku by canoe with a group of 11 people, including children, "
"elderly people and my daughter, Samai. At the Challawayaku port, I found "
"that the Bobonaza River had not grown much, it was navigable. So, I took the "
"decision to set sail at 4:30pm, calculating that I could arrive in Sarayaku "
"after nightfall. However, the canoe’s engine did not start and we had to "
"sleep outside at the port. This turned out to be a fortunate turn of events "
"because, had we managed to set out that day, we would surely have perished. "
"We later discovered that the Bobonaza River had flooded further downstream "
"and a bridge had collapsed, forming a dam-like barrier across the river. In "
"the dark, the canoe would inevitably have crashed heavily against the bridge "
"and sunk. The engine’s failure to start saved all our lives."

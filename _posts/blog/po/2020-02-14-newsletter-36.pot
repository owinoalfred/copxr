" 100% At the end of January, XR's **Global Support (GS)** hosted a call attended by **50 rebels from all around the globe**. It was the first call in the history of XR where countries met and decided together how to rebel. \n"
"We decided to create  **Waves of Global Rebellion** during the same period (April - June) all over the world. \n"
"Many groups have already set their dates: **Venice** - FEB 20, **Netherlands** - APRIL 13, **Switzerland** - APRIL 16, **USA, Mexico City** - APRIL 20, **Africa Climate Week - Uganda** - APRIL 20-24, **Italy** - APRIL 24, **Finland, Germany, France, Australia, Canada** - MAY 4, **Austria** - MAY 11, **Spain** - MAY 18, **UK, Argentina, Ireland, Italy** - MAY 23,  **Norway** - JUNE 2, **Sweden** - JUNE 6, **Hong-Kong** - JUNE 7, **Brussels** - JUNE 12.  **Other groups are joining and sharing the dates of new Waves.**\n"
"This 'Wave of Rebellion' will build towards the strategy of mass disruption for [COP26](https://www.ukcop26.org/) in November.\n"
"If you want to join a project group or add the next wave to the calendar, please write to us at <events@organise.earth> or [join us on Mattermost](https://organise.earth/xrglobal/channels/events--gatherings).\n"

"\"I am 68 years old, now retired after a career as a **probation officer, Court Welfare Officer and most recently as an NHS Psychotherapy Manager**. \n"
"This is the first time I have been charged with any offence and **I have not found it easy putting myself in this situation … and appearing in court today on the other side of the fence** from my previous professional appearances. \n"
"I didn’t want to do this and found it hard knowing that our actions in April were causing disruption and inconvenience to many people’s lives. **But I felt impelled to act in the face of the catastrophic future I saw unfolding before us all.**\n"
"I have long been concerned about climate change, and in the past attended demonstrations, signed petitions and wrote letters to my MP. \n"
"**But like many people, I only half accepted the magnitude and immediacy of what was facing us, and largely carried on with my life.**\n"
"So yes, I acknowledge that I broke the law, but we desperately need urgent governmental action around the world to avert disaster, and **I hope you will accept that I was true to my own morals in trying to play a small part in making that happen.**\"\n"

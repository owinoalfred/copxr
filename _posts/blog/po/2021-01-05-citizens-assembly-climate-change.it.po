"Citizens’ assemblies (CAs) aim to give greater political power to citizens. "
"Members of the public who accurately represent those living in the country "

"High-quality information is presented over a series of meetings, covering "

"This process is a form of ‘deliberative democracy’. Most modern democracies "
"limit citizens’ power to voting, but deliberative democracy requires "
"citizens to deliberate, learn, and collaborate on decisions. It’s been "
"gaining attention since the American professor Joseph M. Bessette wrote "
"[Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government]"
"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy) in 1980. The "
"beginnings of the practice of deliberative democracy, however, might be "
"prehistoric. Athens founded the first recorded democracy around 600BCE, "
"which favoured decisions made by a group of randomly selected citizens over "
"appointed representatives."

"> It is important with a citizens’ assembly that you get the full range of opinions, otherwise policymakers won’t take it seriously. There were people who have a very sceptical view of climate change or don’t think it’s a very high priority, and there were people for whom it was the top priority. But I didn’t notice any clashing; I noticed people listening to each other and respecting each other.\n"

"Tuesday 12th November 2019, Paris (FRANCE) – Eight Brazilian indigenous "
"leaders led a spirited protest along with 100 supporters in a Parisian "
"financial center today, targeting the key role of French investors behind "
"mounting human rights and environmental destruction in the Amazon. France "
"hosts several leading financial institutions - such as BNP Paribas and "
"Société Générale - responsible for bankrolling deforestation in the Amazon "
"and Cerrado biomes with billions of euros in loans and underwriting to "
"corporations that deal directly in forest risk commodities such as soy and "
"beef."

"Leaders from the Association of Brazil’s Indigenous Peoples (APIB) are on an "
"intense advocacy tour across Europe denouncing an exacerbating human rights "
"crisis faced by the country’s indigenous communities and territories under "
"the Bolsonaro’s government. Entitled [Indigenous Blood: Not a Single Drop "
"More](https://en.nenhumagotamais.org/), the delegation calls on European "
"political authorities and business leaders to respond to growing violence "
"and environmental devastation in the Amazon and across Brazil. On November "
"1st, an indigenous Forest Guardian, Paulo Paulino Guajajara, was [shot dead]"
"(https://amazonwatch.org/news/2019/1101-indigenous-forest-guardian-murdered-"
"by-illegal-loggers-in-brazilian-amazon) after illegal loggers ambushed him "
"on his Amazonian territory, in yet another emblematic case of brutality "
"against Brazilian environmental and human rights defenders."

"“Many European companies are exploiting the Amazon directly in our "
"territories,” said Sonia Guajajara, a member of the APIB delegation. “Today "
"we are already feeling the effect of this unrestrained exploitation, and it "
"won't take long for it to also reach you here, in France. European "
"corporations must be conscious of their responsibility. Everything is at "
"stake: the rainforest, the climate, and our survival. It is very important "
"to act quickly while there is still time!\""

"Last April, data from an APIB [report](https://amazonwatch.org/"
"news/2019/0425-complicity-in-destruction-2), produced in partnership with "
"Amazon Watch showed how European and US companies, including banks and soy "
"traders, enable today’s crisis in the Amazon region. The research analyzed "
"Brazilian companies fined for environmental crimes in the Amazon since 2017 "
"and identified linkages between these and northern countries' commercial "
"interests. Recent events, such as the Amazon fires, increasingly show how "
"local and global corporate interests are driving deforestation, exacerbating "
"land conflicts, and spurring violence."

"“Big banks and large investment firms in particular play a critical role, "
"providing billions of euros in lending, underwriting, and equity investment "
"to soy and cattle companies,” said Christian Poirier, Amazon Watch Program "
"Director, who joined the protest in Paris. “This financing enables "
"agribusiness to maintain and expand operations, causing further devastation "
"to the Amazon and Cerrado. BNP Paribas has over US$3 billion invested across "
"the world's four largest soy traders, as well as other investments in "
"Brazilian meat-packers.”"

"Cattle ranching and soy production are the leading drivers of deforestation "
"in Brazil. Ranching alone leads to approximately 80% of Amazon "
"deforestation, and 80% of the Amazon forests cleared since 2014 are "
"currently occupied by cattle. The economic and environmental implications of "
"these commodities extend to the global market: Brazilian soy accounted for "
"14.3% of the country’s total exports, generating $31 billion in 2017 while "
"cattle exports accounted for about $5.4 billion. Brazil leads the world in "
"exports of both commodities. If global consumers continue to provide a "
"market for these commodities, these industries will enjoy considerable "
"economic incentives to aggressively expand activities, to the detriment of "
"forest protections and indigenous land rights."

"“Extinction Rebellion stands by APIB and its leaders in their efforts to "
"amplify the role of the global financial sector in Amazon destruction "
"through an international solidarity campaign. Because the genocide against "
"indigenous people in Brazil is real, forces must be joined among allies in a "
"battle for survival. Extinction Rebellion is their global ally, one country "
"at a time,” said an Extinction Rebellion France spokesperson who attended "
"the Parisian protest."

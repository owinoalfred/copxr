"It’s sometimes asked why Extinction Rebellion (XR) doesn’t set out any "
"solutions to the climate and ecological emergency. Some critics argue that "
"highlighting the problems is easy, but that XR isn’t doing the difficult "
"part: providing the answers. It’s true that attempting to tackle the climate "
"and ecological emergency is an incredibly complex and challenging task, but "
"it isn’t an impossible mountain to climb."

"A quick Google search of “what are the solutions to climate change?” offers "
"plenty of answers. This obviously comes with the standard health warning "
"that not everything on the internet is true. However, sticking with "
"[reputable sources](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/climate-solutions) "
"tends to result in similar solutions coming up fairly consistently. These "
"same suggestions can also be found in numerous books, [articles such as this "
"one](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/climate-change/how-to-fix-it/index."
"html), TV programmes and films on the subject. You’re also likely to find "
"some of them in the environmental action plans of governments and businesses "
"(albeit, often in a more limited or diluted form than the situation "
"demands). Greater caution is advisable when looking at these; in some cases "
"their inclusion stems from a genuine desire to protect the planet, but in "
"others they’re just [greenwashing](https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/transport-"
"travel/what-greenwashing). So, the truth is, we know what needs to be done - "
"absence of solutions isn’t the issue, it’s unwillingness to put them into "
"practice at the scale and pace that’s required."

"For example, there’s widespread understanding that air travel generates "
"harmful emissions and that reducing it would be good for the environment. "
"Research has shown that [a large proportion of these emissions are generated "
"by a small minority](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/17/people-"
"cause-global-aviation-emissions-study-covid-19). There’s little argument "
"that the solution requires reductions in air travel and the primary obstacle "
"is reluctance to do this. This manifests itself not only in the "
"unwillingness of some individuals to amend their behaviour, but also the "
"reluctance of governments to incentivise or force change through means such "
"as frequent flyer levies or other legislation."

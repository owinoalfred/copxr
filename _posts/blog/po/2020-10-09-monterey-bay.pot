"In 1931, Monterey Bay was a sewer, and it seemed impossible that it could "
"ever improve. The once-plentiful sea otters, that locals and explorers had "
"pursued for their fur, were presumed extinct; the crowds of whales that "
"sailors had once hunted were gone; the giant kelp forests were a "
"long-vanished memory. Even the abalone that had sustained the Native "
"American population in the area had nearly vanished. Humans had wiped out "
"one sea creature after another over the past two centuries in the name of "
"commerce."

"However, there were a few people who refused to give up on Monterey Bay. One "
"of them, marine biologist Julia Platt, had been fighting for decades to fix "
"the ecological issues of Monterey Bay. In 1899 she moved to Pacific Grove, a "
"photogenic seaside hamlet next to the canning city of Monterey. Pacific "
"Grove had begun as a summer seaside campground for Methodists, but the "
"pollution made the beaches unusable and the smell wafting from Monterey made "
"conditions almost unlivable."

"Platt then ran for mayor – and won in a landslide, a notable thing for an "

"to convince the California legislature to create some of the first marine "
"sanctuaries in the world, along the coastline right off Pacific Grove. This "
"gave her the leverage she needed to sue the canneries and stop their most "
"egregious violations, and gave marine species a protected area that would "
"become key to their survival. But she died in 1935, long before she got to "
"see the true results of her work."

"wild. A recent genetic survey of the abundant sea otters in Monterey Bay’s "
"Elkhorn Slough revealed that [60% of those "

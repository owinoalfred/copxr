"Esteban Servat is an Argentinian scientist who worked in Silicon Valley "
"before returning to the Mendoza province where he created a self-sustaining "
"community. Before his arrival, the local community had successfully fought "
"against mega-mining projects from western multinationals including Coro "
"Mining and Barrick Gold. Ten years later, the government of Argentina began "
"sponsoring fracking projects - again for the profit of western "
"multinationals like BP or Total. These projects destroy Patagonia’s "
"landscapes and threaten the health livelihoods of its inhabitants by "
"contaminating precious water sources. Children in areas with fracking wells "
"are dying of leukemia at a rate three times higher than the national "
"average. In the face of this threat, Esteban became an activist to stop the "
"projects."

"As Esteban dug deeper into the fracking project process, he uncovered a "
"document that revealed the process’ huge environmental impact. The "
"government was attempting to bury the evidence and replace the study results "
"with fakes to make sure the local population would not take action and fight "
"against the fracking wells."

"Having discovered the incriminating document, Esteban and other activists "

"documents exposing environmental scandals. They then released the document "

"Local residents were outraged and organised into the largest anti-fracking "
"movement in Argentina’s history. This also caused the government to pay "
"close attention to Esteban’s activism. The government brought trumped-up "
"criminal cases against Esteban and fellow activists in an attempt to bully "
"them into silence. Following a mounting campaign of violence against him and "
"his family, including death threats, Esteban went into exile to Berlin, "
"Germany."

"Big oil companies like BP, Total and Shell are actively engaged and even "
"subsidised by European governments to acquire huge amounts of land in "
"Argentina to frack for oil when fracking isn’t allowed by those same "
"governments in their home country. This is a direct continuation of colonial "
"systems of oppression and extraction of resources. Western countries do not "
"apply the same standards to their projects in other countries as they do in "
"their own backyard. This allows them to extract cheaply and enrich "
"themselves at the expense of front-line communities that suffer the "
"consequences of these practises."

"European activists for example must organise to force multinational "

"Giovanni Tamacas, a 20-year-old US student and international coordinator "
"with the [Global Hunger Strike](https://rebellion.global/"
"newsletters/2019/10/31/global-hunger-strike/), said: “We are hunger striking "
"because we have no choice. We are being taken to our deaths. Greedy "
"governments and corporations have criminally and catastrophically failed to "
"tackle the climate and ecological emergency. Our shortsighted governments "
"are too systemically corrupt to stop mass starvation, societal collapse, and "
"the death of billions of humans. We are therefore demanding that governments "
"commission and be led by the decisions of an independent Citizens’ Assembly "
"on climate and ecological justice.”"

"with him this month. “I did cry. And I did feel extreme frustration and "
"hunger and just overwhelming feelings of sadness at times,” said Tamacas. "
"“But at the end of the day I remembered what I was fighting for and that’s "
"what kept me going.” Tamacas’s mother is from Vietnam and his father is from "
"El Salvador, countries that are reeling from climate and ecological collapse."

"The hunger strikers recognize that what they are doing is minor compared to "
"the truly dire starvation that ten percent of the world’s population faces. "
"They have the privilege of being able to choose when to eat, so the strike "
"is carried out in solidarity with communities worldwide and particularly "
"with those in the Global South who are forcibly starved. They also strike in "
"solidarity with prisoners, migrants and racially marginalised peoples who "
"hunger strike as a last resort against systemic oppression. And they do "
"strike in solidarity with those who have pioneered, and continue to use, "
"this incredibly powerful last resort tactic as a means to liberate "
"themselves from the shackles of depression, apathy, and oppression."

"This is the first time I have been charged with any offence and **I have not found it easy putting myself in this situation … and appearing in court today on the other side of the fence** from my previous professional appearances. \n"
"I didn’t want to do this and found it hard knowing that our actions in April were causing disruption and inconvenience to many people’s lives. **But I felt impelled to act in the face of the catastrophic future I saw unfolding before us all.**\n"
"I have long been concerned about climate change, and in the past attended demonstrations, signed petitions and wrote letters to my MP. \n"
"**But like many people, I only half accepted the magnitude and immediacy of what was facing us, and largely carried on with my life.**\n"
"So yes, I acknowledge that I broke the law, but we desperately need urgent governmental action around the world to avert disaster, and **I hope you will accept that I was true to my own morals in trying to play a small part in making that happen.**\"\n"

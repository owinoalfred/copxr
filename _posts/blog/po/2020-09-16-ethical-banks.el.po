Contact them before you start the bank switching process to let them know why you’re unhappy about their support of the fossil fuel industry.

"> I have become aware of the extent to which your bank is involved with financing fossil fuel projects. Coal and gas are driving an array of unacceptable environmental risks. I don’t want my money helping an institution that is funding such destruction, especially when there is a wealth of clean, renewable energy alternatives available.\n"
">\n"
"> I also consider it an economic risk to retain my money with your bank. There is a growing awareness of the fact that fossil fuel assets will become risky investments as the world moves to combat climate change. I do not want my money with a bank that is investing in assets that may soon become stranded, and investing in companies whose value may plummet as the world turns away from fossil fuels.\n"
">\n"
"> I am moving my money to ensure my own finances do not support an industry that is polluting the environment, and I hope my action will also make your bank reconsider future investments in the fossil fuel sector. I hope you do not have to receive too many more letters like mine before you realise that investing in fossil fuels is no longer morally responsible or financially viable.\n"

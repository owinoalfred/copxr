"We need to think about climate change in the same way we think about cancer "
"- there isn't a safe level, which is why we need to take immediate action "
"before it gets even worse. Another sobering parallel is that we can’t say "
"with certainty at what point a cure will no longer be possible. There are "
"incredibly [complex inter-relationships](https://climate.nasa.gov/"

"feedback loops to become established. This complexity means that it’s "
"impossible to predict with any confidence when tipping points might occur "

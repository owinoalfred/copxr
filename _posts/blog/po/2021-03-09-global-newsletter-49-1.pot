"Continuing our focus on animal agriculture, Cronon’s book merges history and "
"ecology to describe the shift between one form of land management and "
"another. An excellent case study of the deeply-entrenched cultural, "
"economic, and political realities we continue to struggle against today."

"OK, this one has little to do with animals—it’s a cautionary novel about "
"geoengineering—but out of everybody who wrote in recommending books this "
"month, almost half of you recommended this one. “As (possibly well-meaning) "
"leaders everywhere grasp for ‘fixes’ in preference to fundamental behaviour/"
"system change, XR readers might be usefully reminded of the dangerous "
"consequences of ‘geoengineering’” (David)"

"food was waiting. Fellow rebels had already heated all the food and put it "

"chance, to give with love, was so precious to me. In those stressful moments "

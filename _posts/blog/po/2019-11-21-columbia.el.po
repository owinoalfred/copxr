"21st November, 2019 - Bogotá (COLOMBIA) - Carlos Aldairo Arena Salinas is "
"the latest environmental defender to fall in Colombia’s attack on life. The "
"44-year-old environmentalist was shot to death on a farm in the central "
"Andean region of Tolima in Colombia. As a local farmer, he had branched out "
"and promoted the Route of the Condor, an ecotourism project which gave "
"people the rare opportunity to catch a glimpse of the famed endangered "
"Andean Condor, the country’s national bird. Arenas Salinas gave his life to "
"save the Condor from extinction by sharing its majesty with those who "
"cared.  As the sixth mass extinction advances, so the few brave souls who "
"resist are cut down by a system so toxic it ultimately will kill everything "
"in its path."

"Fellow activist Katherine Ariza tweets of \"Eyebrows\", as Arenas Salinas "
"was known as \" a defender of water, the valley of the Frailejones and all "
"of the highland’s (paramo) creatures. He had so much love for the highlands, "
"he fought for their preservation until the end. Last night, no doubt doing "
"something that would risk his life one last time, he is said to have been "
"slain by criminal gang in the Totarito sector.” Colombia weeps, and the "
"world grieves."

"For the third consecutive year, Colombia was among the three most dangerous "
"countries for the life of environmental defenders. In its [report](https://"
"www.globalwitness.org/en/about-us/annual-reviews/), British NGO Global "
"Witness, states that “in 2018 an average of more than three activists per "
"week were killed, defending their lands from the invasion of industries such "
"as mining, logging and agribusiness. The actual figure is likely to be much "
"higher because cases are often not recorded and rarely investigated. It is "
"difficult to find reliable and verifiable evidence.”"

"According to the local Wayuu people, the Cerrejón, one of the largest coal "

"Pandemics, ecology, and climate are hopelessly intertwined. The climate and "
"ecological crisis sickens and displaces both wild animals and human "
"beings. It creates excellent conditions for pests like ticks and mosquitoes "
"to breed as well as for deadly bacteria to multiply. And it literally thaws "
"ancient pathogens from the ground. All of these lead to disease, which, when "
"left unchecked, can result in pandemics.  ﻿ This post explains some of the "
"less-visible connections between infectious disease and the climate and "
"ecological crisis; how many pandemics begin; and how, by fighting against "
"environmental destruction, we can also play a part in preventing the next "
"pandemic."

"Pandemia, ecologia e clima estão irremediavelmente interligados. A crise "
"climática e ecológica adoece e desaloja animais selvagens e seres humanos. "
"Ela cria condições excelentes para a proliferação de pragas como carrapatos "
"e mosquitos, bem como para a multiplicação de bactérias mortais e "
"literalmente descongela antigos patógenos do solo. Tudo isso leva a doenças "
"que, quando não controladas, podem resultar em pandemias. Este post explica "
"algumas das conexões menos visíveis entre as doenças infecciosas, o clima e "
"a crise ecológica; como muitas pandemias começam; e como, ao combater a "
"destruição ambiental, podemos também contribuir para a prevenção da próxima "
"pandemia."

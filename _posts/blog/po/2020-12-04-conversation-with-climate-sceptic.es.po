"The ‘false choice’ fallacy is one way in which corporations or the media try "
"to manipulate people into believing what they want them to believe. They "
"will often put forward two different arguments which are seemingly opposed, "
"and suggest that people have to decide, morally, which side they’re on. Upon "
"closer examination, however, you will see that it is not an ‘either–or’ "
"choice at all."

"JP: In the Ecuadorian Amazon, the Siekopai nationality was the first to "

"blow for the Siekopai because they aren’t many of us and we all know each "
"other. Then a teacher died, he had long been involved in the struggle to "
"defend our culture. It was a very difficult situation. We sought help from "
"the local and national governments, but they didn’t really respond. Some "
"allied organisations provided medicines, tests and accurate information. But "
"we started to realise that the medicine from outside, it wasn’t helping "
"us. Faced with many cases of Covid, we started to look to medicinal "
"plants. In the end, the majority of people who survived were treated with "
"medicinal plants. And we’re still treating people with plant infusions, such "

"we keep maintaining our ancestral chakras (traditional small-scale "

"missionaries arrived in Siekopai territory, that there were around 30,000 to "
"40,000 Siekopai at that time, in the zone between Putumayo, the Aguarico "
"River and Napo. The missionaries brought illnesses such as flu and measles, "
"which extinguished 90% of our population. Whole peoples and clans "
"disappeared. Very few survived, hiding in the depths of the jungle. Then the "
"rubber tappers arrived and removed the Siekopai even from there. So that’s "
"how we lost our territory. We used to have a large population and territory, "
"whereas now we only have around 700 people in Ecuador, living in a very "
"reduced area. We feel very threatened, very worried because our territory is "

"worried. Many Siekopai don’t want the roads, but others do. There is a part "
"of the community that isn’t really conscious of what our territory means, "
"because of influence from the outside world. I’m not saying the outside "
"world is bad, but we have to find a balance between the two worlds, to "

"There is one important and relevant story that I’d like to share. One day, "
"some people from the village walked for half a day to go fishing in a river "
"with barbasco (a plant substance used to stun fish so that they can be "
"caught easily). When they arrived at the river, they started making their "
"camp. One man left the group and went to find Juri, the spirit of the wind, "
"who lived in a gigantic tree. The man asked Juri for permission to fish, as "
"she was the owner of the river. She denied his request, saying that it was "
"not the time for fishing, that they would have to wait. The man returned to "
"the group and relayed what Juri had said, that they mustn’t fish, but his "
"companions became angry and didn’t listen to him. They had walked a long way "
"and were hungry, they wanted to eat. The man went once more to speak to "
"Juri, who insisted that he stop his friends from fishing. But when he got "
"back to the river, they had already caught and killed a lot of fish, they "
"were smoking them over a fire and eating happily. In trepidation, the man "
"went to tell Juri what had happened. The spirit of the wind became "
"furious. She told the man to hide in a cave with his family. He ran to get "
"his family, leaving his companions eating fish. On the way, he gathered some "
"orchids, which he used to block the entrance to the cave. The orchids turned "
"into dogs and guarded the family. Suddenly, the sky darkened and there was "
"such a strong wind that tree branches were falling. The family could hear "
"cries of desperation from the camp by the river, for Juri had removed the "
"eyes of all the people who had been fishing, so that they could not return "
"home. The animals of the jungle came, the jaguars, wild boars and ants, and "
"devoured the people at the camp. Only the family in the cave survived."

"I embarked on this path one day when I returned home from the city and found "
"my mother very sick. In my desperation, I decided to drink yajé, in order to "
"be closer to her if she died. In my yajé visions that night, I was walking "
"and walking in the darkness and I couldn’t find the light. I was shouting "
"and crying, I felt like my heart was broken, empty. I felt terrible pain in "
"my soul, the worst pain I have ever felt in my life. It’s not possible to "
"explain it. Eventually, after I had walked and shouted for so long in the "
"darkness, a light appeared next to me and said “I am your god.” I was deeply "
"confused. I thought, why is god here in my yajé vision, when he should be "
"over there in the church? I couldn’t see the entity’s body, but it was "
"wearing a white shining suit. And it said to me, “don’t worry, your mother "
"won’t die, she will be well tomorrow. Keep following this path, I will keep "
"lighting the way for you so that you can do things well.” I left the "
"ceremony at 5am and went back home and my mum was fine, she was working in "
"the chakra. I couldn’t believe it. And that changed my whole perspective on "
"religion, on yajé. I understood that the true god is within all of us, in "
"our positive actions, when we help each other, when we collaborate. God "
"isn’t found in the church, but with each of us. That is what I learned "
"through yajé."

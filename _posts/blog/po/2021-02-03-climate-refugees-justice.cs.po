"Fertile Crescent—spanning modern day Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, "

"[a total of 79.5 million people forcibly displaced by the end of 2019]"
"(https://www.unhcr.org/uk/figures-at-a-glance.html). Historically, displaced "

"their homes. Scientists are also investigating the role that climate "
"breakdown plays in displacing people from their homes. The environmental "
"question has become so prominent that it has given rise to a new term"
"—‘climate refugees’."

Knowing this, members of the militant group coerced him into eventually joining them as a means of survival. He probably repeated the extortion he had faced and participated in other oppressive activities—perpetuating both poverty and violence. He joined al Shabab not out of ideology, but hunger.

"While climate change is a complex problem in need of a unified global "
"response, every individual effort towards building a safer future is "
"valuable. By making changes to our individual lifestyles based on "
"environmental concern, we can help to influence the attitudes and behaviours "
"of those around us in relation to addressing the climate crisis. We can lead "
"by example and assist in sending a message to those in positions of power "
"that we will not stand for ‘business as usual.’ If you’re hesitant to take "
"direct action in the form of [joining a climate change protest or "

"You’ve probably noticed that the term “carbon footprint” is used a lot when "
"discussing climate change. But what exactly does it mean? A carbon footprint "
"is a way to measure greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases are gases "
"such as carbon dioxide and methane that trap heat in the atmosphere and "
"thereby contribute greatly to global warming. A carbon footprint is "
"determined by the sum of these greenhouse gases that are released into the "
"atmosphere either directly or indirectly by our actions (usually in tons per "
"year). This can be applied to individuals, families, companies, events, "
"products and even countries."

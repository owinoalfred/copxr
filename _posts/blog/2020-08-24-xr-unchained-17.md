The project, which has strong government backing, would involve up to 850 coal seam gas wells being drilled on 1,000 hectares of a site that includes the [Pilliga forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilliga_forest), the largest remaining woodland wilderness in New South Wales (NSW). Santos says it could provide up to 200 terajoules of gas a day for 20 years, equivalent to 50% of NSW demand.

It is the longest river in Poland. It was and is of great importance in every corner of the country. As children, we sang songs about her and listened to her legends. The [Vistula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vistula), queen of Polish rivers, is drying up due to climate change and disastrous corporate and human actions.

On 10 August, in the light of the setting sun and by the symbolic statue of the Warsaw Mermaid, XR Warsaw and a broad range of animal, youth, and environmental activists witnessed the Vistula’s funeral.

![](/assets/uploads/unchained17-image24.jpg)

On the second anniversary of Fridays for Future, [rebels blocked a main road](https://youtu.be/WlXE1lCaKCw) in Finland’s capital to protest against the new [Datteln 4 coal-fired power station](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2020/01/09/wont-let-germany-build-new-coal-power-plant/) in Germany. The plant is operated by Uniper, a subsidiary of the Finnish state-owned energy company Fortum.

The action was in support of the climate youth who called an European-wide action day against Datteln 4. 19 brave rebels got detained and were given fines for disobeying the police.

On its website, Fortum calls itself “a leading clean-energy company” and says a focus on reducing CO2 emissions “has been in Fortum’s DNA for decades.” Friends of the Earth Germany (BUND) estimate Datteln 4 will emit 8.4 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.

One of the hunger strikers said: “We have one demand to the government, which is to commit to cutting carbon emissions by 20% by the end of 2021, and then by a further 20% every year so that Finland is carbon neutral, or net neutral, by the end of 2025.” Photo: News Now Finland.

### 7 AUG | St Ives, UK

One year after Cornish rebels performed their moving beach action, [The Sea Is Rising and So Are We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_XcaAdjfTo&feature=youtu.be), a single red rebel retraced their steps. His anniversary action was as witness and a lament - a lament for lost lands, lost peoples, lost ocean life, lost Arctic ice and lost coral reefs. A year on, nothing has really changed other than the sea has risen further.

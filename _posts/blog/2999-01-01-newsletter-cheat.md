## Hi there,

Here's a helpful cheat-sheet / component library to use when transplanting the newsletter from the email version to the web version. Feel free to add whatever you think helps!

### **Formatting**

* Please ensure everything that is in italics or bold in the main newsletter version is transposed.
* In terms of URL slug, please use the following formats:

global-newsletter-\[newsletter number goes here]

xr-unchained-\[number goes here]

* Please ensure the social description is filled out for the main newsletter and Unchained. For Unchained, you can use the following: "Actions from across the world that we couldn't cram into the newsletter this month."

### **Links**

The Google Doc will have comments in the margin as to where links should be placed. Based on the date you click the publish button, you can determine what these should be.

For the main newsletter:

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/01/12/global-newsletter-[number goes here/

 For Unchained: 

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/11/12/xr-unchained-\[number goes here]/

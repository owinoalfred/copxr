A true Atlas from XR Austria

Dear rebels,

The wave of rebellions continues! Rebels are sounding the alarm across the globe and inspiring more and more to take action for the planet. Despite extremely challenging circumstances, individual doubts, and police brutality, still we rise up as one unified (decentralized) movement.

## UnBEElievable Rebels Swarm Vienna

26 SEP - 4 OCT | Vienna, Austria

![](/assets/uploads/e4d81eab-a8ac-458d-b0ca-66b571a4268d.jpg)

The XR Austria concerto: one solo instrument accompanied by a rebellion.

The Austrian Rebellion kicked-off with an energising [Rebel Ride](https://www.facebook.com/ExtinctionRebellionAustria/videos/767623887395057/), despite the police trying to shut it down by banning the use of the motorway. Like water, the 80 riders simply took another route to the opening rally in Sigmund Freud Park!

The ‘Honeycomb Campaign’ saw rebels swarm the city’s main square, Michaelerplatz, and establish [hexagonal lock-on formations](https://www.facebook.com/ExtinctionRebellionAustria/videos/742482259664096/) and [hexagonal blockades](https://www.facebook.com/ExtinctionRebellionAustria/videos/2718882358364637/) on key roads in reference to our third demand of Citizens Assemblies. Genius!

The police even [stood up](https://twitter.com/LPDWien/status/1311962614906474496?s=19) against hate messages and calls for violence against non-violent rebels!

The final rally at Maria-Theresien-Platz marked a ceremonial hand-over to XR Germany, Italy, and Spain for the next waves of the Rebellion.

## Fast Fashion: Exposing the Naked Truth

26 SEPT | Prague, Czech Republic

![](/assets/uploads/1e2498fd-003e-4a29-aeca-fb69412174ae.png)

The Protestor’s New Clothes.

Four rebels bared all on Prague's luxurious Příkopa Street to protest fast fashion. The rebels glued themselves to the inside of a shop window completely naked except for signs with messages like ‘Fast fashion kills, I'd rather be naked’.

Other rebels draped a banner outside the shop that read: ‘There is no economic growth on a dead planet’.

Police ripped the rebels from the glass and shut down the store, apparently to “protect the public” from the peaceful protest.

![](/assets/uploads/4a68dd12-a243-4247-a795-dc51a1e7ecea.png)

Shoppers in Prague were greeted by a bold message.

One rebel [said](https://a2larm.cz/2020/09/rychla-moda-nici-planetu-fotoreport-z-protestu-extinction-rebellion-v-zare/): "Fast fashion is the second most polluting industry in the world, responsible for 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

“By buying fast fashion, we accept that the quality of human life is less important than cheap clothing. Gigantic companies that use the fast fashion model literally benefit from modern-day slaves, and privileged Europeans allow this because they also benefit.”

## No Water, No Life!

25 SEP | Port Elizabeth, Pretoria, Cape Town, Johannesburg, South Africa

In cities across South Africa, rebels took to the streets with a coalition of activist groups to mark the 6th [Global Climate Strike](https://globalclimatestrike.net/), a day of worldwide climate protest called for by Fridays for Future.

Rebels in Mandela Bay organised a coalition march to the City Hall of Port Elizabeth, where they protested against the city’s continuing water crisis.

The region is suffering prolonged droughts made worse by neglected local infrastructure and political inaction on the climate crisis. Many residents do not have access to even basic sanitation.

The activists [called on the mayor](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10160254511961982&set=gm.636779873936319&type=3&eid=ARBOpE-Tf7DE3bVe0hYDfhDlYcgA0XzYpzNnHqBbOChlQZAu_CcNK9NUyPS1KpRqVZQdHZhVBGqYaf8A&__tn__=EHH-R) to reject plans for a costly and polluting desalination plant and instead solve the water crisis with a climate jobs programme and green infrastructure.

Mandela Bay rebels assemble for a day of marching

In Pretoria, the activist coalition marched to the Department of Mineral Resources and handed over a memorandum demanding [a green restructuring of national electricity provider Eskom](https://350africa.org/greenneweskom/), and an end to government promotion of fossil fuels.

Activists also braved heavy rains in Cape Town to rally outside Parliament, where they demanded an immediate transition to renewables and an end to coal power.

This week rebels in Johannesburg [will demonstrate against Standard Bank](https://www.facebook.com/events/649874612336227/) for their funding of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline, which will link Ugandan oil fields to ports in Tanzania. The 900-mile heated pipeline [has a carbon footprint equivalent to Denmark’s](https://e360.yale.edu/features/a-major-oil-pipeline-project-strikes-deep-at-the-heart-of-africa) and will devastate local wildlife as well as small farmers.

## Helsinki Police Hit The Brake

3 OCT | Helsinki, Finland

![](/assets/uploads/58ef65e0-8d76-4d16-84c1-ba3c02ba497f.jpg)

Rebels in Helsinki were pepper sprayed by police and stopped from washing their eyes during an ‘Emergency Brake’ blockade in the city centre.

Police also detained 49 peaceful demonstrators, including pensioners, children, teachers and nurses.

The protest, part of XR Finland’s Autumn Rebellion week, involved blockading Unioninkatu, a major street in central Helsinki. Around 200 rebels decorated the area with flags and banners, a small yellow boat sailed in with “Tell the Truth” on its sail, and people danced to live music.

![](/assets/uploads/25d940c4-15b5-4041-a80d-ff20d58a5d85.jpg)

But when their order to leave was ignored, police came in hard, dismantling the blockade and carrying protestors into police vans. When rebels moved to a nearby intersection and sat down to block traffic, police started pepper spraying them at point blank range.

10 protestors suffered serious effects and many more were forced to take off their face masks to breathe, ruining rebel attempts to adhere to Covid-19 safety measures. Police even stopped some rebels from washing their eyes with water.

All detainees were eventually released, and XR Finland has [condemned the violent police response](https://www.facebook.com/elokapina/posts/2740232682859891?__tn__=K-R). Their Autumn Rebellion week will continue as planned until Wednesday.

Some rebels were stopped from washing the pepper spray from their eyes.

XR Switzerland joined the September Rebellion wave with Rise Up For Change, their first ever mass action.

Around 400 protestors from XR, Climate Strike Switzerland, Greenpeace and other allied groups gathered at 4:30am on Monday morning to set up camp in Bern’s Bundesplatz (Federal Square). They occupied the square for nearly 48 hours before police forced a cold and rainy evacuation that dragged on for 6 more hours.

At the camp, rebels held their own Citizens’ Assemblies, debates, conferences, and talks, while choirs and nighttime concerts kept spirits high. Doctors4XR hosted an action right on the doorsteps of the Federal Palace.

A 3000-strong march capped off the week of rebellion, with members of various climate groups standing shoulder to (distanced) shoulder and sending a clear message to their leaders.

## Fashion Act Now

Despite the rise of ‘sustainable fashion’, the industry remains one of most polluting and wasteful. And with global fashion consumption predicted to grow by 63% over the next decade, efforts to make the industry sustainable could be easily overshadowed.

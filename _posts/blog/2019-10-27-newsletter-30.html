October 27, 2019 by Extinction Rebellion

<p><strong>This rebellion is by no means over</strong>: the past week has seen continued actions in <strong>Austria</strong>, <strong>The</strong> <strong>Netherlands</strong>, <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, <strong>Berlin</strong>, <strong>Sydney</strong>… as ever, more than we can count!
</p>

<p>But for many of those reading, this week was the beginning of some well-earned rest, and the start of a reflection process.
</p>

<p>In this first of several <strong>retrospective issues</strong>, we 
begin to look back together on the October Rebellion. We bring you 
exclusive accounts that could only be articulated once the heat of 
action had cooled a little.
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://i2.wp.com/can2-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/data/000/336/231/original/berlinbamboo-min.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Berlin rebels gather, featuring bamboo tripods</figcaption></figure>

<p>Undeniably, this Rebellion has seen XR <strong>step up across the world </strong>–
 in terms of numbers, intensity, creativity, visibility, and more. We 
saw a leap in the profile of those declaring their support for the 
movement, with royalty, actors, journalists, and politicians using their
 platforms to support XR, and some even facing arrest.
</p>

<p>Rebels in many countries have <strong>developed their civil disobedience superpowers, </strong><strong>deploying new and creative tactic</strong><strong>s</strong>
 – in this issue, we see how cross-national solidarity between rebels 
has been used to the advantage of protests in Central Europe (Slovakia, 
Czech Republic).
</p>

<p>At the same time, we have seen the <strong>police step up its response to XR in sometimes shocking and brutal ways</strong>.
 More than during the April Rebellion, it is as if brute force has been 
mobilised in the service of shoring up the denial of climate and 
ecological breakdown. Rebels seem undeterred however, even where they 
are facing a public still largely unaware of the emergency (e.g. Czech 
Republic, Italy).
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://i0.wp.com/can2-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/data/000/336/234/original/austriayouth-min.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Austrian XR Youth take a dramatic stand</figcaption></figure>

<p>The crucial process of <strong>holding to account those involved in the Rebellion has begun</strong> – and we don’t mean only the courageous arrestees: as we detail below, investigations into police excesses have started in <a href="https://www.brusselstimes.com/brussels/73091/probe-launched-into-unacceptable-violence-by-police-against-extinction-rebellion-activists/">Belgium</a>
 and in the UK. (In the UK an investigation is being conducted by Netpol
 into excessive or discriminatory policing – they need eye-witness 
statements to make their case please <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H4r7xI3RaCgFbu8RhSjFa_0vI4BpgrHdxN2PrfJTrYY/edit?usp=sharing">see here</a>
 to help. If you’re not in the UK, but have had similar experiences, we 
can only encourage you to contact legal networks to begin a similar 
process!)
</p>

<p>Taking responsibility is not something we merely ask of others: the 
time is also for apologies where these are felt to be necessary, for 
example, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ExtinctionRebellionBE/posts/543271136502664?__tn__=K-R">heartfelt letter</a> from XR Belgium to members of the public and rebels caught up in the police response.
</p>

<p>This retrospective newsletter features longer pieces that allow 
rebels to share their experience of Rebellion more intimately. We are 
struck by the raw humanity of rebel hunger strikers in <strong>Italy</strong>; the pain of the 14-year-old rebel from <strong>Slovakia</strong>,
 brutally unglued by the police. The often touching photos lay bare a 
whole spectrum of emotions – cheekiness, anger, puzzlement, 
determination, playfulness. <strong>A reminder of our complex but ultimately common humanity</strong>.
</p>

<p>As these reflections begin to paint a fuller picture of the whirlwind that was Rebellion, it seems clear that <strong>what we have lost in innocence, we have gained in numbers, in determination, in skill and in solidarity.</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>Whatever the future may hold, this at least is clear: we are 
now a community of truly international scale, and we will not stop until
 we see the change we need.</strong>

<h3>This City Never Sleeps…
</h3>

<em>OCT 20 – 25 | London, UK</em>

<p>October was massive for UK rebels. And for many who strained heart and sinew, the time has come for some well deserved rest. &nbsp;
</p>

<p>But some push on, with <strong>inventive and powerful protests.</strong> &nbsp;
</p>

<p>On Sunday, a small group of rebels<a href="https://rebellion.earth/2019/10/20/bp-portrait-awards-targeted-by-extinction-rebellion-activists-pour-crude-oil-over-naked-bodies-within-the-performance-crude-truth/"> stripped off on the floor of the National Portrait Gallery</a>, while others<strong> poured fake oil over their naked bodies</strong>.
 The gallery is the home of the BP Portrait Award, an exhibition funded 
by oil and gas company ‘Beyond Petroleum’. The action highlighted the <strong>tragic destruction of life </strong>caused by the drills and spills of oil and gas companies like BP.
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CZ4E2R9FjRgtxXZvfT31yHCUvtid8Suu3hfQ4BNjQpiWcCZ6RMH2NIpCLuqZx9La8Lt6qizypzo5ZLwaNAv-Bz-mh8HUEGpn56pApDkAdQpHjo_cipFjCjJ3iljVJUKdhg72fh13" alt=""></figure>

<p>The following day, XR families and <a href="https://rebellion.earth/2019/10/21/teachers-scientists-parents-and-children-protest-at-department-for-education-to-demand-climate-truth-be-taught-in-schools-and-universities/">educators called on the Department for Education</a> to ‘tell the truth’ and bring the climate emergency into the school curriculum. 
</p>

<p>“<strong>Climate and ecological breakdown will define the life of every child alive today,</strong>”
 said one rebel, “but it’s hard for them to take the issue seriously, 
when it plays almost no part in the content of their education.”
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QDcH975r90bzC6JtMiwAEhNx3fgXg76rvWSgBb_5yU9rgd9KRRXi2o99Pt0SvVSutESKpgQvmHFUDy-4kJ1LbSGeTHwnDErsu6iJBoUrpIVz3RJItywYkLV9jLRIPLTODsvqzs3E" alt=""></figure>

<p>Little rebels brought a first ever <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ExtinctionRebellionFamilies/posts/2491314754447548">love-in to the Maritime Museum</a>. United in song, they stood in <strong>solidarity with families across the world already impacted by climate change</strong>, especially those in the global south. They also visited the new home of our Polly Higgins boat and honoured <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/22/polly-higgins-environmentalist-eradicating-ecocide-dies">Polly’s fight to make ecocide a crime</a>.
</p>

<p>Coming up this week in London, we have a Rebellion-inspired piano concert <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/457610948188230/"><strong>‘Music From Our Times’</strong></a><strong> on Wed 30</strong> and a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/547711839330320/"><strong>Rebel Rave</strong></a><strong> on Fri 1st</strong> to raise money for legal aid for our brave arrestees (<a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1324937">buy tickets here</a>).
</p>

<p>If you can’t make these but feel like tying up some loose ends, a 
debrief might be the thing you need – and the good news is, setting them
 up just got a whole lot easier with this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uDaRbXqrcxCrpv2SG4Hgx73jwgyH0-FGBrqVJj0VTO0/edit">guide</a>.
</p>

<p>We’d also like to encourage any rebels who were present in London to take a look at this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H4r7xI3RaCgFbu8RhSjFa_0vI4BpgrHdxN2PrfJTrYY/edit">request from Netpol</a> – your statement could make a crucial difference in holding the Met to account for their actions earlier this month.
</p>

<h2>Looking Back</h2>

<p><em>More happened in October than we could possibly report on. Each 
country’s rebellion has its own joys and tribulations, its own unique 
flavour. Read on to be seriously inspired!
    </em>
</p>

<h3>Shocks to Political Culture in France 
</h3>

<em>OCT 5-13 | Paris, France</em>

<p>The October Rebellion enabled XR to introduce itself to the French 
media and political world, and to a large part of the population. This 
spectacular introduction, intended to draw more rebels in, laid the 
foundations for even more disruptive and dramatic actions in the future.
 
</p>

<p>There is little doubt that this week of massive non-violent civil 
disobedience created a shock wave in the country of ‘La Grande 
Révolution.’  <strong>XR’s political aims and methods have struck many other protest movements in France as culturally strange</strong>, especially those on the radical left. 
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mISUztohJsjVx99sYzSbZfJcIohkI0ElQe5glQOccMin_eLaLDz6uD5vTQJIEPr9iYCCi-kQD94TYsjAz66CVNCA0-e1yltsiTKrJcK-W01QpX3szG1u6jN4-sNr-maWMojNjumn" alt=""></figure>

<p><em>The sun sets after a fifth day of occupation in the centre of Paris</em>
</p>

<p>The difference between XR and more ‘traditional’ methods of protest 
in the country, as well as its political message, drew critiques and 
commendations from social and anti-authoritarian movements, public 
commentators and intellectuals alike. These certainly deserve to be 
heard and thought through, even if they indicate a certain reactionary 
attitude within the French left itself. 
</p>

<p>These criticisms could prove to help XR France mature, and provide a 
fruitful disruption and inspiration for other social movements in the 
country.
</p>

<p>In effect, the October Rebellion has offered an opportunity for both 
XR France and movements such as the Yellow Vests to grow more impactful,
 both in strategy and in their political aims and messaging. 
</p>

<p>Having begun to form alliances <a href="https://rebellion.earth/2019/10/08/xr-unchained-aaaand-were-off-international/?link_id=35&amp;can_id=54b822cf8e46ca1da066a06d60944eb7&amp;source=email-rebel-daily-1-the-sun-rises-on-a-new-wave-of-rebellion&amp;email_referrer=email_636120&amp;email_subject=rebel-daily-1-the-sun-rises-on-a-new-wave-of-rebellion">in the first days of the rebellion</a>, <strong>now is the time to reflect on how to collaborate more successfully with one another moving forward</strong>.
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GjDuY6ttsQmC0T_VunKFwa1-ZBD-8BJrMcYzO4yMfW2iFnbdNFfTgGlzQcemVoVBwtvp-IkmB6CNpFds9kQ_hKxKnXc_EskFIgJXkMexIbKKfNLvtZgKOkUD1IUMuaSVNtdgy4we" alt=""></figure>

<p><em>On October 5th, XR co-occupied a Parisian Shopping Centre with the Yellow Vests and other groups</em>
</p>

<p>In the face of the task ahead of us, we might together concede that 
we will need a full spectrum of tactics to reach our shared goal: that 
is, <strong>to dismantle the toxic structures which are the source of this generation’s emergency</strong>.

<h3>The Czech Rebellion: Battered, Bruised, but Never Knocked Out
</h3>

<em>OCT 7-12 | Prague, Czech Republic</em>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/157LFidznPkyF5QwVbUZilwQTtUG7RuP1tSTJVj1iIAVEWZrFmUSGOF1kw2ZmrsHohWEHN-Z0nk01Dq4gA81io7j4sG74C01I0KSUxWmtHuWyvhJE8kmsZ74i8byEqFhSmXP-gdG" alt=""></figure>

<p><em>Potential new recruits at ‘Fragile Hope’, an XR Prague Parents event</em>
</p>

<p>Saturday 12th marked the final day of a <strong>week-long rebellion </strong>for XR Czechia, and the day was to hold<strong> two of their most audacious actions</strong>.
</p>

<p>Rebels took over Wenceslas Square, one of Prague’s busiest, to hold a<strong> ‘Saturday Festival’</strong> full of live music, theatre, and workshops about the climate and ecological crisis. Meanwhile, on an adjacent highway, around <strong>200 rebels formed a blockade</strong> to stop the capital’s afternoon traffic. At least eight rebels glued themselves to the road.<br>
</p>

<p>Police managed to clear the blockade in under 15 minutes, but they did so <strong>brutally</strong>. It resulted in one woman being <strong>scalded </strong>with hot water (which police believed would dissolve the glue), another woman suffering <strong>significant bruising</strong> as she was hauled away.
</p>

<p>And a 14-year-old girl having<strong> skin ripped away from her hand</strong>. She was glued to another rebel and the police, who appeared <strong>unprepared and seemingly unaware of the practice,</strong> simply tore them apart.
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BE1--ObcufNusHBzjHm_mMIYqNmDuWgA7X1p6TnMV9pjmSMANIl1PUQnn_nwVCQtXS9bITUzR3RAh1CVbLGQMyXlh2-X71UlWuIAhpfyCIeuuduys_6g6MkPDUGL4g_egavdZatT" alt=""></figure>

<p><em>The 14 year old girl whose glued hand was torn free (Photo: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/zewlakkaktivistckefoto">Petr Zewlakk Vrabec</a>)</em>
</p>

<p>As <strong>she cried, a rebel medic tried to help her</strong> but 
the police had already formed a cordon around the road and wouldn’t let 
anyone through. ‘We have our own medics,’ was the police response.
</p>

<p>The police medics did eventually arrive and were seriously alarmed, 
mistakenly believing the girl’s hand was dissolving from chemicals in 
the glue. She was <strong>rushed to hospital in an ambulance,</strong> her mother by her side.
</p>

<p>On the journey, the girl was given a misdemeanour citation and was released a few hours later.
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/J1FS10WBpt90S2vd4BcLuY5TvVEhRGo6V9Ti2komN5HggeUCF_E_KqtjsiLK7h4SWfVr4qAQHNtWjXloSLWMW9gTrDV2fpBz_i4lUyWNcUgBLRMCh4LILEbLTukwB-iVS7wJmU4d" alt=""></figure>

<p><em>Police held the blockade rebels for five and a half hours</em>
</p>

<p>Most rebels were kept for far longer. There were <strong>130 arrests in all</strong>,
 and the police seemed totally at a loss with how to deal with so many. 
They decided to process all of them, including the minors and the 
injured, in an impromptu holding area by the road.
</p>

<p>Those rebels whose ID cards had already been registered by the police
 after previous actions were arrested and bussed to the local police 
station. Whilst they were ultimately released later that night, they are
 <strong>likely to face substantial fines</strong>.
</p>

<p>Those rebels whose IDs showed no previous XR activity were cautioned 
and eventually released after a five-and-a-half-hour wait on the 
roadside. They sang and chanted throughout the night to keep their 
spirits high.
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5AwSmU4L0BzdnJSxMohGP_pS5byjw0_M5g3NoUcLK-iV4_wr02ykU9EBDMI6cs-SIJ-JsiQATITptoF4EihP1kdnYhfQ8dk_HXAtL9NmFVq3HkZkfC3Rzpzc4WFBCx0jez2aMSA6" alt=""></figure>

<p><em>A road swarm meets with anger on the streets of Prague</em>
</p>

<p>XR Czech Republic is spearheaded by a <strong>loving group of around 400 dedicated activists.</strong> Generally speaking, though, public opinion is not with them — in part because of a <strong>hostile corporate media </strong>that misreports actions and sidelines the climate crisis entirely.
</p>

<p>Through their Saturday Festival and other events across the week, Czech rebels have sought to recruit a new wave of rebels; <strong>but they also know that to change this nation’s mindset, they have a lot of work ahead.</strong>
</p>

<h3>Slovakia’s Rebellion: History Quietly in the Making
</h3>

<em>OCT 7-12 | Bratislava, Slovakia, and Prague, Czech Republic</em>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cen4uOx6339mFCDWa1DZU0OX9KuMYEc0ix4TnEU-iG9Zhx3LFxWvrGDkjk8frsNBIs739fT1oi6FmkOG4yjtFbTNP_F-uqamkJVKuvN07XXx-ePi8PkCWIreX0KKR1-ZUE8817H1" alt=""></figure>

<p><em>The first ‘swarm’ in the history of Slovakia</em>
</p>

<p>It is the morning of Monday 7th October, the first day of rebellion 
for so many across the world. Twenty Slovak rebels walked in single file
 across a zebra crossing on a street outside the <strong>Ministry of Economic Affairs in Bratislava</strong>.
</p>

<p>But rather than cross the street, they blocked it. Two big hand-painted XR banners were unfurled to face the waiting traffic.
</p>

<p>People in their cars looked bemused, unsure about what was going on. A
 bus driver started to get angry, inching his large vehicle closer to 
the rebels, gesturing and shouting from behind the glass. Thankfully the
 agreed seven-minute wait was up before things could get violent, and 
the rebels part like waves.
</p>

<p>The traffic returns to its normal flow, and no police arrived. It is 
as if nothing had happened. But the beaming rebels know differently. 
</p>

<p>This was their first-ever direct action. It was Slovakia’s first-ever swarm. <strong>This was seven minutes of history.</strong>
</p>

<p>Later that day, the rebels notified Slovakia’s national media about 
this milestone. They also hosted a seminar about how to turn kitchen and
 bathroom household waste into garden compost. The press interest was 
muted however: the next morning, <strong>only one newspaper ran the story.</strong>
</p>

<p>XR Slovakia is only a few months old and its membership is still 
modest in size. In spite of this, actions came thick and fast during 
Rebellion Week. On Wednesday 9th a group of <strong>seventy cyclists rode through Bratislava, passing various Ministries and gridlocking traffic</strong>. Again the police did not impose, and no one was arrested.
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_zv5-jMKYSVntlKf8d-U_yYke5uc60SHh1wJjysToPBLievYGFYKv6Xg192w9JlyIm3Ns_DSnxzm8WKjZYjpOFcIsbd-UarPLRVveG8Kp7IprvweZy7stnWt4Ee-J_tEYkN8OsEi" alt=""></figure>

<p><em>Three Slovak women on the front line of the rebel blockade in Prague</em>
</p>

<p>The next day, Thursday 10th, <strong>twelve rebels took a trip to Prague to join their Czech sisters and brothers</strong>. All were part of the Saturday blockade that saw the Czech police kettle nearly 200 rebels, injuring two women and a teenage girl in the  process. </p>

<p>The Slovaks’ foreign status actually helped them in this instance. 
The added bureaucracy involved in processing their foreign ID cards 
meant that the overstretched Czech police were never going to arrest 
them. Instead, the visitors spent their last night on the roadside, 
chanting with their Czech comrades for the five and a half hours it took
 for the police to release them.
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ari_XKAj2MJWlWdEgoaLRKRQf020zTd4wwzX5B64pZOYDYlHNxTOHVnR1_J3NhxDrxRM6ZEdbV6LKKVsPeSVIjYNmLBngYKNm6i5wxnSwRLhob4ruzW_IaByu4ydsbVig755rCG7" alt=""></figure>

<h3>The Rome Rebellion: Bikes, Lies, and Videotape
</h3>

<em>OCT 7-13 | Rome, Italy</em>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NWCe4M6pF-OID1j4z2H5uopg5nZ4WGLGAqkx5xta65Lpm9nC_F1qbYyXnMoaUmRmsP8442V6xioo8cGIb7sJ9VGCiz88xaRUyaIUgil1XYnfgQ5WB5v-PUxhSL4dZ_utDravn45G" alt=""></figure>

<p><em>Critical Mass passes through Piazza Venezia</em>
</p>

<p>Asked for her favourite action of the week, a rebel from the Rome media team smiles and answers quickly: ‘The Critical Mass. <strong>A hundred and fifty of us riding bikes</strong> through the centre of the city, blocking traffic for three hours’.
</p>

<p>Italian police knew the starting point of the action and followed the
 swarm of bicycles in two big trucks as the riders cut through red 
lights and <strong>brought the city streets to a standstill</strong>. But there were no arrests. In fact, <strong>there have never been any arrests of rebels in Italy.</strong>
</p>

<p>‘The police just video-record our faces,’ says the rebel from Rome. 
‘Throughout the week, over the course of seven major actions, the police
 have just watched and waited and filmed everyone.’
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GSyNnd6j3USL-Qr-MUQgob4EcKxvHAwzJynYdMvBRVlraZVS3gdGQRAtFZhswaR9SuPZq9rG914i44wPo7RGJxnKGDS0mYKtRA1ncD1Dn0ifTafhfglH4q6HP7VEOwJR9-31Nz98" alt=""></figure>

<p><em>Italian rebel on day six of his hunger strike</em>
</p>

<p>A public endorsement from <strong>Michael Stipe, lead singer of REM</strong>, visiting Rome for an art convention, gained press coverage but it was the <strong>rebel hunger strikers</strong> who sat in a square outside the Italian Parliament which drew the most media attention.
</p>

<p>Of the fifteen who started, ten hunger strikers made it through the 
whole week. Three were forced to end their strike because of health 
fears. But thanks to a couple of supportive MEPs, the hunger strikers 
were visited by Italy’s Environment Minister, Sergio Costa.
</p>

<p>The senior politician listened to the hunger strikers, but only for a
 minute or so. He had a more important agenda for this meeting: turning 
to the assembled press and lauding his<strong> ‘emergency bill about the climate’</strong>, a bill that had passed into Italian law only the day before.
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Q8AN9JTjV3BxWiMvRJ016s38SnpeOZAUvMy8O02rrumCdkIcq5IJ1jXTCfIp0pTdAtFvMouKTdOnXUJBIp-uiAXnbushFQupYgh0SKNWO-D_T2DOxOFTRHVbYb8RrClPAtxpGEeR" alt=""></figure>

<p><em>Rebel hunger strikers outside Montecitorio Palace, the Italian parliament</em>
</p>

<p>Like so many similar bills which have been lauded by governments 
around the world, the substance did not match the title. While the bill 
introduces measures to tackle plastic use and offers financial 
incentives for drivers of older model cars to upgrade it remains silent <strong>on the issues of carbon emissions, fossil fuel usage and air travel.</strong> The phrase ‘fiddling while Rome burns’ has rarely been more apt. &nbsp;

<p><em>Environment Minister Sergio Costa meets the hunger strikers</em>
</p>

<p>It was a real achievement that the hunger strikers got any press coverage at all. <strong>Mostly, the Italian media has ignored the climate and ecological crisis</strong>, and totally ignored Extinction Rebellion’s efforts to highlight it.
</p>

<p><strong>The vast majority of people in Italy don’t know that there is a climate problem, let alone its true scale.</strong> During the actions in the capital, the most supportive passers-by were tourists.
</p>

<p>XR Italy is comprised of only a couple of hundred dedicated rebel hearts, but<strong> the week of actions has done wonders</strong>,
 both in terms of the skills and systems that have been passed on 
through workshops, and the bonds that have been created through direct 
actions. Trust and camaraderie has grown strong between these rebellious
 Romans, and <strong>new chapters are now springing up daily</strong> around the country.
</p>

<p>One thing is for sure. The Italian police will be needing to record more videos.

<h3>Brussels Revisited
</h3>

<em>OCT 12-13 | Brussels, Belgium</em>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/HMCUccZTZlvF-DJU7xjVAQm81S7d6m7VDn4SaPKQANhDNeNjVICTxPZDD4KoQGR4smmaFDjEvHax0NwtuICYYQlinUKIDFZfNEpOetScNXluoDp7xOw_NV2psTYaDkxJbHKU3SKc" alt=""></figure>

<p>Many of us were shocked by the events in Belgium on Saturday 12th, when<strong> over 400 peaceful rebels were savagely beaten, soaked, pepper-sprayed, and arrested</strong> on their first day of protest.
</p>

<p>Authorities in Brussels have since <a href="https://www.brusselstimes.com/brussels/73091/probe-launched-into-unacceptable-violence-by-police-against-extinction-rebellion-activists/">opened up an inquiry</a> exploring the <strong>unlawful conduct of the police</strong>. A total of four separate<a href="https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2019/10/22/four-disciplinary-investigations-into-alleged-police-brutality-a/"> disciplinary investigations</a> have been launched to address the potential use of <strong>excessive force and unacceptable violence</strong>. 
</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we spoke to a rebel on the ground about his experience of the night: <strong>‘It’s hard to describe what it’s like to be hit in the face by pepper-spray.</strong> <strong>The best comparison I can think of, is hell</strong>. Everything burns and you feel completely disoriented. Out of this world. You can’t see, or smell, or even breathe.’
</p>

<p>‘<strong>It’s like someone has poured a cocktail of tabasco and bleach down your throat. </strong>And there’s nothing you can do. Water makes it worse. You just have to wait it out.’
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jFytlW27Q8aB-r5SjdjW_Pvc9aO2i61GnIMn8_8ZDne6uCFZmOghtsiJI6S4nijVa0tQvBX8a23Avouow0F6yDflRzt9o4dzeCDBDkWumP8h3brUnlqKaWy29OF66TPSDHFGeHss" alt=""></figure>

<p>Rest assured, Extinction Rebellion will be paying very close 
attention to the results of the police enquiry. On Tuesday 15th, XR 
spokesperson <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=517045218851015"><strong>Linde Polfliet appeared on national television channel VRT</strong></a>to discuss our <strong>peaceful values </strong>and denounce the <strong>criminal actions</strong> of the police.
</p>

<p>XR Belgium have also released a <strong>heartfelt statement </strong>addressing ‘the negligent and stupid <strong>brutality of the illegal police action </strong>that ruined a truly beautiful and inspiring afternoon of citizen cooperation’.
</p>

<p>The statement generously apologises to all XR members and members of the public who were caught up in ‘<strong>the nightmare </strong>that we all experienced.’ It celebrates the<strong> indomitable spirit </strong>of those who made the stand and ends with a reminder that: <strong>‘the system, of which we are part of, is afraid</strong>. It does not know what to do (…) It needs our help to go forward. <strong>It needs us.’</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>Deeds not Words</strong><br>
</p>

<p><em>An overview of police response to the October Rebellion, in London and around the world.</em>
</p>

<p>Our <strong>October Rebellion </strong>received many different 
responses: energy and excitement from new rebels across the world, love 
and community with returning rebels, curiosity from passersby, some 
grumbles from grumpy commuters in a rush, but also a new level of 
intimidation and aggression from the police.
</p>

<p>In London, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/05/london-police-arrest-extinction-rebellion-activists-in-advance-of-environment-protest">police swooped in before the rebellion even began</a>, raiding a storage space, confiscating equipment, including<strong> <a href="https://rebellion.earth/2019/10/05/you-cant-confiscate-an-idea/">dangerous pink pillows</a></strong>
 and making arrests. Over the following days, police continued with 
arrests and confiscated all manner of items from rebels, including food 
and tents. 
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DaYoXzvv---j351CF_sIyWWaoWT9dWWa9_oqIHpolSWZseO7ksUadxAXa3LzjgetjdITXJTorJFqlVV3PO3D5GvK_zTidYqVkLBzln8XVpmf5dli3-F7q01Xh-vclgBPJIj6WUwy" alt=""></figure>

<p>In true rebellious spirit, <strong>pink pillows popped up </strong>all
 over London and the Rebellion was on again. Rebels continued to defy 
police aggression, even when it hit an all time low with police 
targeting more vulnerable rebels by<strong> confiscating wheelchairs and equipment supporting disabled rebels</strong> to protest.
</p>

<p>But as the rebel spirit couldn’t be knocked down, the police responded with increasingly draconian measures <strong>curtailing the right to protest</strong>; initially by restricting protest to Trafalgar Square and then <strong>banning all XR protests from London</strong>.
</p>

<p>Greta <a href="https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1184188303295336448">tweeted</a>:
 ‘If standing up against the climate and ecological breakdown and for 
humanity is against the rules then the rules must be broken’.
</p>

<p>The disproportionate <strong>London-wide ban on XR protests</strong> backfired. Galvanising support from those who recognised how dangerous a development this was, including <strong>Amnesty International</strong> who called the ban<a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/extinction-rebellion-blanket-ban-chilling-and-unlawful">chilling and unlawful</a>’. Green Party Co-Leader <strong>Jonathan Bartley</strong> and journalist <strong>George Monbiot</strong>
 were amongst those arrested the following day for deliberately defying 
it. The legality of the ban is now being challenged in the High Court, 
while Netpol is launching a parliamentary report which you can help with
 by <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H4r7xI3RaCgFbu8RhSjFa_0vI4BpgrHdxN2PrfJTrYY/edit">offering a statement</a>.
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MNl_goT2q4dSK3S5DHIUYdRtlCPrso8cyfGrZZykE8I_gazqoaVtBYJGdGxCpg2p29eMGeRUU9e3DkkNoilG8IzuNq3Bv9YcrK1myuXnrKAM4H2JHoNuZSw2x9YkUeJXl5lHG2vS" alt=""></figure>

<p>Unfortunately the UK hasn’t been the only place where, instead of 
acting on the climate and ecological emergency, politicians have instead
 turned on peaceful protest. 
</p>

<p>In Australia, the <strong>Queensland parliament</strong> criminalised locking devices and extended <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/24/queensland-parliament-passes-laws-to-crack-down-on-climate-protesters">police powers</a>, shortly after Australian police faced criticism for their use of strip searches and imposition of extreme <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/absurd-bail-conditions-prevent-extinction-rebellion-protesters-going-near-other-members">bail conditions</a>.
</p>

<p>Use of pain compliance techniques against peaceful earth protectors 
was reported in Germany and Spain, while non-violent protest in Brussels
 was met with police <strong>violence far beyond anything experienced before</strong>. 
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4UCcDrMpP5ZAHmFaVcHfaryOUnS-x7f-E5EDFBFLg72uH79_T3ahySYK4H8tBvilmFdsNMjJcPdlsEuPRZLitSpgWqsl6GPU9hvQafoqzL0_ZXQAKxI4RQ9rpHOXJN3Jc-5U1T6Q" alt=""></figure>

<p>These extreme responses to peaceful action show that <strong>those in power are running scared and panicking</strong>. Attempts to ignore and ridicule XR have failed and they recognise the force of change we now represent. 
</p>

<p>The way forward doesn’t require further draconian steps on a path 
towards a police state with no civil liberties; all that is needed, is <strong>taking action on the climate and ecological emergency</strong>.

<strong>Alice, 18</strong>

<p>‘I don’t think enough is being done. This feels like a huge joke or something, a nightmare, <strong>but it’s not. It’s the reality. </strong><strong>I just wanted to try anything I can to change this horrible reality.</strong> I think I’d regret not doing anything.
</p>

<p>I think here (the City of London) is the right place to do it. I 
study Economics and I feel so strongly that something has to change. The
 banks should be diverting resources to renewable projects which will 
create jobs. They’re just not doing that, <strong>they’re stuck in their short-termism and their quarterly reports and shareholder values and things</strong>.
</p>

<p>It’s always been really hard for me because I’m an overseas student 
and I used to fly a lot. I think that if I believe that it is such a 
catastrophe then why am I still flying? So<strong> I’ve stopped flying and I’m looking at alternatives such as trains back to Hong Kong. </strong>
</p>

<p>I’m consuming so much less now and I’ve realised that makes me a 
happier person. I grew up in a concrete jungle and I’ve always been 
taught that shopping is fun, but I never really took a moment to 
consider where my happiness comes from. I think that would be true for a
 lot of people, <strong>it’s just the culture that we grew up in</strong>.’

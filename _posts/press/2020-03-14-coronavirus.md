_13th March, 2020, (Global)_  - **Extinction Rebellion**  exists to protect and preserve life, both for now and for future generations.  **Our global movement stands in solidarity with all those affected by coronavirus**.

Extinction Rebellion (XR) welcomes the urgency with which many governments, organisations and institutions are acting in the face of the emergency represented by the Corona/Covid19 pandemic.  **Our current reality requires political will and quick, decisive action to mitigate, adapt and evolve to an existential threat.**

The movement's global network, which came together to face the Climate and Ecological Emergency, is adapting to this crisis, and hopes to be part of the force which connects people in community resilience at this time.

As our ability to gather is greatly affected,  **each Extinction Rebellion group will consider whether it shall carry out any local activity in coming weeks**  and months within the context of the planned International Rebellion. The ongoing Rebellion will adapt to this situation and we expect activities around the world will vary from community aid and assistance, to simply providing connection to people.

As the climate breakdown and ecological collapse continues and we see more outbreaks and pandemics, Extinction Rebellion will work to provide a growing community of compassion and care, and create spaces to put into reality how the world could be different. Now is the time to show how humans can come together and showcase other ways of existence. We must pull together as communities, protecting the most vulnerable.  **We must Rebel for Life.**

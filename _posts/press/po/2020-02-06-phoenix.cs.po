"The 2 minute short film, set in an Emergency Room, launches a new campaign "
"to engage the public in different aspects of the Climate and Ecological "
"Emergency. It acts as a Public Service Announcement (PSA) for the plight of "
"the Amazon and its indigenous communities, and an alarm call for "
"deforestation and biodiversity loss taking place in every corner of the "
"globe, as a result of devastating wildfires, droughts, floods and storms."

"The involvement of Joaquin Phoenix comes as no surprise, given his history "
"of activism. Phoenix was recently arrested at a protest organised by the "
"actress Jane Fonda in Washington DC, where he spoke about the link between "
"climate change and animal agriculture.  ![joaquin-phoenix-xr](/assets/img/"
"press/2020/02/06/JoaquinStill_006.jpg){:.img-fluid .my-4} Commenting on the "
"film Phoenix said: “It’s really a call to action. I did it to raise "
"awareness about the meat and dairy industry’s effect on climate change. The "
"fact is we are clear cutting and burning rainforests and seeing the negative "
"effects of those actions worldwide. People don’t realize there’s still time, "
"but only if we act now and make sweeping changes to our consumption. We "
"can’t wait for governments to solve these problems for us. We can’t wait "
"until the election to try to make these changes. We have a personal "
"responsibility to make changes in our own lives and act now.\""

"Shaun Monson, the film’s Director, said he felt compelled to make the film "
"as previous documentary style PSAs had failed to move audiences to take "
"action: “so instead of focusing on deforestation, ice melting and species "
"extinction, we use a story as a metaphor. The Amazon has been called the "
"lungs of the world, or the heart of the world, but instead of documentary "
"footage we proposed an ER setting with doctors and nurses trying to save an "
"unseen patient with systemic heart failure. The twist is not only who one of "
"the paramedics is, but what they were really fighting to save all along.”"

"Leila Salazar-López of Amazon Watch believes the film is an example of art "
"reflecting life: “An indigenous woman saving the Amazon is not a metaphor: "
"it is a daily reality as the rainforest is razed and indigenous lands are "
"invaded for profit. The Amazon rainforest is the heart of our world, and "
"indigenous forest guardians are central to its well-being and to our "
"collective future.”"

"The film is the first of a twelve-part series planned by Extinction "
"Rebellion, in collaboration with Mobilize Earth. Each will tell a story "
"about the most pressing issues facing the human species as we move into what "
"most scientists, politicians and the public see as the make or break decade "
"for the survival of life on the planet.  For Matthew Modine, one of the "
"film’s stars, the Climate and Ecological Emergency means: “children "
"inheriting a world unrecognizable to the one I was born into … this PSA is "
"one way of opening people’s eyes to see what is actually happening right in "
"front of us.”"

"Gail Bradbrook, Co-Founder of Extinction Rebellion, hopes that this is one "
"of the first signs of Hollywood beginning to use its influence to tell the "
"truth about the gravity of the Climate and Ecological Crisis: “There is "
"still a disconnect between how bad things are and the action that needs to "
"happen. But that gap is narrowing. There are more significant people "
"starting to break ranks, to tell the truth and act as if it is real.” !"

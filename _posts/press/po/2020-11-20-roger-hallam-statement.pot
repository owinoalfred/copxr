"In November 2019, after comments Roger Hallam made on the Holocaust, the "
"Global Support Tech team witnessed mass account deactivations across its "
"global services. The German team cited a particularly heavy fall in their "
"membership base. This was the first time Global Support Tech had seen "
"negative growth since our global communications platforms were deployed, "
"with thousands of rebels leaving our platforms."

"On more than one occasion in 2020, Roger Hallam “jokingly” suggested that "
"leaders responsible for the climate and ecological emergency should be "
"shot. Joke or not, these statements damaged our otherwise strong commitment "
"to non-violence in the public eye and increased concerns about XR being "
"classified as a terrorist organization."

"Roger Hallam helped set up “XR America”, which both complicated existing "

"result, the Latin American XR movement dissociated itself from Global "

"Our highest priority at Global Support is to encourage the strong, "
"efficient, and regenerative global growth of the XR movement. It is clear "
"that Roger Hallam has become a highly divisive figure both in the global "
"movement and within Global Support. While we recognize his groundbreaking "
"early actions and extraordinary work in co-founding XR, we can no longer "
"allow the controversy around his later statements and activism continue to "
"damage our work."

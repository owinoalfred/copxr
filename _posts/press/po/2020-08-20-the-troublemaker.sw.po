"Roger Hallam’s reputation as the eponymous ‘Troublemaker’ is a double-edged "
"sword, praised by some and vilified by many inside and outside of Extinction "
"Rebellion. Whatever your opinion of the man, it cannot be denied that his "
"journey from one-time organic farmer, to social science theorist and "
"one-time co-founder of XR, to ‘political independent’ without a formal role "
"in any XR group, makes him a uniquely interesting place to start a story of "
"ideas. This is especially true given the prevailing context of political "
"weakness and cynicism."

msgid "**Saturday, December 7, 2019 (Madrid, SPAIN) –**  Members of Extinction Rebellion (XR), coming from more than 20 countries, blocked the street of Gran Vía with their dance moves to “Staying Alive” as part of an action held across 23 cities around the world, starting in Bali, Indonesia and many other cities(Paris, Amsterdam, Sydney, New York, etc.). \"Civil-discobedience\" is the latest artistic expression of the social movement that aims to mobilize society to cope with the ravages of climate change and defend life on the planet. This action echoes the quote attributed to feminist activist Emma Goldman, \"If I can’t dance, it’s not my revolution.\"\n"

"This action aims to highlight that the climate and ecological crisis is a "
"global phenomenon that requires joint and coordinated action from civil "
"society, worldwide. Rebels from all countries and continents show that civil "
"society, unlike political and economic elites, can build agreements that "
"focus on what is most important, that crosses borders and supports the "
"regions most affected by this crisis. There is no time for hope, it is time "
"for action. Therefore, civil disobedience actions must be inclusive, "
"creating participatory environments where everyone can feel comfortable and "
"cared for. That is exactly what «civil-discobedience» does: rebellion at the "
"blow of the hips."

"Inspired by an action by XR Australia, hundreds of XR rebels from all over "
"the world gathered in Madrid to exert pressure on COP 25 and invited others "
"to participate in a spontaneous dance, breaking into the streets and squares "
"of the world to the sound of the disco music, so that life lasts, "
"emphasizing the message of the BeeGees: «Staying alive.» We need to stay "
"alive. In Madrid, the musical styles were representative of various across "

"December 31st, 2019, (Planet Earth) - When a group of ordinary citizens, "
"inspired by scientists, agreed to set-out on an outrageous idea with great "
"expectations back in April 2018, never could they have imagined the impact "
"their experiment would have across our planet. Gravely aware of how society "
"has failed to cope with the worst existential crisis humanity has ever "
"collectively faced, the notion was to finally take charge in an issue "
"negligently ignored by the governments of the world, by creating the largest "
"climate related civil disobedience movement in history. As 2019 draws to a "
"close, Extinction Rebellion (XR) pauses to look back on some of the year’s "
"milestones."

"To disseminate and deliver their demands, XR organized two international "
"rebellions, in April and in October. The April rebellion took London by "
"storm, breaking through citizen’s indifference, as rebels came out to "
"celebrate life in the heart of the British capital for two solid weeks. XR "
"groups made their global debut in Buenos Aires, Paris, Buenos Aires and "
"Sydney, to name a few places. Actions resulted in thousands of arrests, "
"generated economic losses in the millions and even moved the British "
"Parliament to declare a climate emergency - the first legislative body in "
"the world to do so."

"Extinction Rebellion had single handedly shifted the conversation and forced "
"the world to talk about the climate and ecological emergency. The rest is "
"history, as the rebellion spread to the farthest shores. From France to "
"Germany, South Africa, Ghana, India, New Zealand to Chile, XR’s stylized "
"hourglass, flew over Earth’s most unexpected corners, with the exception of "
"a single continent: Antarctica. For now. Day by day, rebels around the "
"planet wove alliances, be it with established environmental organisations, "
"such as Greenpeace, or new movements like Fridays for Future. Crucially "
"though, it reaches out to diverse sectors of civil society and especially, "
"to people. “The climate and ecological emergency knows no borders,” explains "
"23 year-old Dutch student Pippi Van Ommen, \"if the sea level rises up by "
"two meters, my hometown, and much of my country will not survive. I was not "
"an activist before. I heard about Extinction Rebellion through Instagram and "
"now I dedicate all my time, despite having had to hand in my thesis over "
"Christmas. XR is not right or left. It represents all social sectors and age "
"groups, there is no hierarchy and everyone is welcome.\""

"One of the most iconic images was a call to “Rebel for Life”, emblazoned "
"across pink and yellow ships, moored across the world’s major cities, in the "
"middle of the street. “We are all in the same boat” is the message it "
"embodies, launching it into the public’s and rebels’ imaginations alike, as "
"it rides the cusp of the global Climate Spring’s wave. Described by CNN as "
"“the world's most high-profile environmental movement,” Extinction Rebellion "
"is different. It is radically different, being a movement of engineers, "
"doctors, unemployed, retired, students, scientists, journalists ... in "
"short, it is a movement of ordinary, or rather, extraordinary, normal, "
"humans."

"\"XR uses civil disobedience to shake consciences in the face of the climate "
"crisis. It is a group bursting with energy. It appeals to emotions. To a "
"vision of a destroyed future if we don't act,\" explains Egbert Born, a 53-"
"year-old poet from Amsterdam. Adelheid Lüchtrath, a 67-year-old German "
"doctor, summarizes her year explaining how she had “never been arrested, nor "
"fined, but would be willing to spend time in jail, if it helps the climate "
"struggle. I’ve been fighting climate change for 40 years because politicians "
"have done nothing. They do not want to react.\""

"Across the world, XR has met with politicians and governments. A grandmother "
"who went on hunger strike in November in protest at climate change met with "
"Irish Environment minister, Richard Bruton. In Spain, XR met with Ecological "
"Transition minister, Teresa Ribera, as well as with Prime Minister Pedro "
"Sanchez, while Sweden’s environment minister agreed to meet with Swedish "
"hunger strikers. In the United States hunger strikers occupied House Speaker "
"Nancy Pelosi’s Capitol office."

"During COP25, the UN’s 25th yearly climate summit, the movement has cemented "
"its reputation as a serious player at the political table. Despite a last-"
"minute shift to Madrid from Santiago de Chile following social unrest, the "
"global movement made itself felt. Inside, co-founder Skeena Rathor and UK "
"coordinator Tim Crosland met with the presidency and looked towards COP26 in "
"Glasgow, highlighting the need for authentic cooperation and unity in the "
"face of adversity. Outside, XR’s Rebels without Borders, from over 20 "
"countries, manifested through civil disobedience (and discobedience) their "
"outrage every day, culminating with a pile of horse manure delivered to the "
"UN climate summit’s door step. The message attached read: “Dear Leaders…The "
"Horseshit stops here.” A few days later social media analytics company, "
"[Onolytica](https://onalytica.com/blog/), ranked XR as COP 25’s number one "
"influencer."

"Roger Hallam’s reputation as the eponymous ‘Troublemaker’ is a double-edged "

"Rebellion. Whatever your opinion of the man, it cannot be denied that his "
"journey from organic farmer, to social science theorist and one-time co-"
"founder of XR, to ‘political independent’, makes him a uniquely interesting "
"place to start a story of ideas. This is especially true given the "
"prevailing context of political weakness and cynicism."

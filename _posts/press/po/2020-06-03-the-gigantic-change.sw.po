"Whoopi Goldberg has teamed up with Extinction Rebellion in a beautiful new "
"animation set in the future. The stunning 3 minute film looks back from 2050 "
"to show how people came together to save the world from the climate "
"crisis.\\\n"
"The film, entitled *The Gigantic Change*, will go live on Extinction "
"Rebellion’s Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram at 08:00 hrs BST on "
"Friday 5th June 2020, as part of World Environment Day.\\\n"
"As we start to plan how to rebuild our world post-Covid, the film shows that "
"a brighter future really is possible. But this won’t happen on its own; we "
"must all *take action today*. Climate change is an existential threat to "
"people of all ages and backgrounds. The need for collective action has never "
"been greater.  \n"

"above.**\\\n"
"The team behind The Gigantic Change, together with Passion Pictures – who "
"created the famous Orangutan advert for Iceland – knew that Whoopi’s iconic "
"voice would bring a perfect sense of gravitas to the performance. She is a "
"prominent campaigner on environmental issues, so she had the power to "
"inspire many of her followers to take action.\\\n"
"The urgency of the situation clearly resonates with her, and many others, "
"but the challenge is to communicate this urgency to the wider public. This "
"is the primary purpose of The Gigantic Change. After seeing the film, "
"viewers are directed to a simple page outlining the most effective actions "
"they can take to save the environment. This could be anything from diet and "
"travel all the way up to civil disobedience.\\\n"
"Whoopi Goldberg has appeared in such films as The Color Purple, Ghost and "
"Sister Act, and lent her voice to the animated classic, The Lion King. She "
"is one of a select group of artists to earn an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony "
"Award. She has a strong voice on climate issues and is an active supporter "
"of numerous causes and humanitarian efforts.\n"

"Extinction Rebellion believes it is a citizen’s duty to rebel, using "
"peaceful civil disobedience, when faced with criminal inactivity by their "
"government. Time has almost entirely run out to address the ecological "
"crisis which is upon us. The consequences of this crisis include the sixth "
"mass species extinction, global pollution, and abrupt, runaway climate "
"change. Societal collapse and mass death are seen as inevitable by "
"scientists and other credible voices.  Human extinction is also a "
"possibility if we do not take immediate action."

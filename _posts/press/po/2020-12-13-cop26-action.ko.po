"On December 11th, the eve of the 5th anniversary of the signing of the Paris "
"Climate Agreement, Extinction Rebellion launched ‘COP26: We Are Watching "
"You,’ a series of global synchronised projections drawing attention to the "
"lack of action, missed ambitions and broken promises from world leaders."

"Over several nights, a video was projected in 14 cities across the globe "
"including Paris, Glasgow, Washington, Buenos Aires, Mumbai and London. The "
"video carried the message: “COP26: We Are Watching You. Don’t Let Us Down.” "
"The groups intend to raise awareness to issues in COP26 every month in the "
"lead up to the Glasgow summit to offer a message of community and courage "
"during these dark times. The message hopes to stress the deeply "
"interconnected humanitarian nature of the crisis, a crisis which will "
"require all countries coming together to find solutions."

"The project was developed by 20 countries, some of them already deeply "
"affected by climate change. The video focuses on how complex and "
"interconnected issues caused by climate change are disrupting food security, "
"livelihoods and homes around the world. The action aims to highlight the "
"role of COP26 in limiting climate breakdown and compelling governments to "
"take stronger action towards this. Some famous landmarks that displayed the "
"projections include the SEC in Glasgow where COP26 will be held, the Newseum "
"a few blocks from the Capitol in Washington, government and embassy "
"buildings in London, and the Obelisco in Argentina."

"Cathy Allen from XRCOP stated: *“The 25 meetings of COP have so far only "
"achieved the Paris Agreement. Though a start in terms of coming together, "
"the Paris Agreement is not nearly enough to protect humanity. The world is "
"watching as time runs out. Fires, floods, sea level rise, heat waves, "
"drought, food insecurity - all these are happening now. But just around the "
"corner, we can see that much worse is coming. COP26 is a historic "
"opportunity for a just and fair agreement to control climate heating to 1.5 "
"degrees Celsius. The COP26 process is under global scrutiny.”*"

"The aim of the Paris Agreement is (to) ‘strengthen the global response to "
"climate change’ and ‘pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to "
"1.50C above pre-industrial levels’. However, as Antonio Guterres, UN "
"Secretary General outlined on December 2, 2020, global increase in "
"temperature is already 1.20C and rising. ‘*In fact emissions are now 62% "
"higher than they were at the start of COP negotiations in 1990…the world "
"needs to decrease fossil fuel production by roughly 6 per cent every* *year "
"between now and 2030. Instead the world is going in the opposite direction – "
"planning an annual increase of 2 per cent.*’ The Glasgow COP26 faces "
"significant challenges as, currently, few countries, and no G20 country, "
"have targets in line with a 1.5OC temperature "
"rise. (<https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/>) In addition, the "
"$100billion per year promised in the Paris Agreement for climate finance to "
"vulnerable countries, is not being met."

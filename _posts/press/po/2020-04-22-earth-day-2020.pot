"*Wednesday April 22nd, 2020 (Global)*- As our planet grapples with the "
"Coronavirus pandemic, with over 2 million infections, hundreds of thousands "
"of deaths worldwide and a vaccine still far in the future, Extinction "
"Rebellion activates its network, asking rebels from across the world to "
"confirm stories of unusual sightings. With a presence in over 65 countries, "
"the global movement is in a position to bear witness to the striking reality "
"of silent cities. Nature, usually absent from hustle and bustle of human "
"activity, is venturing into spaces left still by human beings. We collect "
"some of the experiences confirmed by rebels.\n"

"Our journey begins with **Extinction Rebellion Uganda**, where Joseph "
"Masembe confirms how “*poaching of wildlife is at its lowest, pollution of "
"the air and water bodies is also down, and deforestation is seemingly at a "
"standstill.*” Speaking from Kampala, Flavia describes “*animals and birds, "
"until previously a rare sight on our streets and backyards, are now "
"common. In Queen Elizabeth National Park, lions are relaxing on the "
"road. These big cats usually hide for most of the day, but now they enjoy "
"the sun and the warm road beneath them. They, like us, are also somehow "
"forced to take it easy. Makes us feel not so alone, somehow.*”"

"Humans are not the only ones threatened by COVID19, points out **Extinction "
"Rebellion Congo**.  “Congo’s Virunga National Park, home to about a third of "
"the world’s mountain gorillas, has closed its gates until at least June,” "
"explains James Kataliko, following “advice from scientific experts who warn "
"that primates, including mountain gorillas, are likely susceptible to "
"complications arising from the COVID19 virus. It is very touching to see how "
"humans also care for the other inhabitants of our country, threatened by the "
"very same virus which has brought such sadness to our planet.”"

"In South Africa, in the Western Cape town of Langebaan, “thousands of birds "
"were seen descending onto the beach in numbers we've not seen before, going "
"crazy over the sardines doing their yearly run along the coast, unfished by "
"humans,” describes Nicole Collier-Naidoo from **Extinction Rebellion South "
"Africa**. “There is something therapeutic about seeing life flourish in the "
"midst of so much sadness, making us more aware of how often we take simple "
"gifts for granted.”"

"Speaking from **Extinction Rebellion India** Ajinkya Chikte, tells of how he "
"saw dolphins swimming near Marine Drive in Mumbai.  “It was amazing to see "
"how soon into lockdown beautiful creatures we had never seen so close, "
"approached our now silent home” explains Ajinkya. “It felt almost as if "
"nature was showing solidarity with our collective suffering by displaying "
"its grace and beauty, where it had been missed, to give us hope for a new "
"tomorrow.”"

"Further to the east, **Extinction Rebellion Australia** confirmed reports of "
"kangaroo sightings deep in cities, in stark contrast to the devastation "
"wrought on the country by the bush fires earlier this year. “It’s actually "
"not unusual to see kangaroos on the street or in front yards of certain "
"suburbs, but it is unusual in the middle of a capital city, as happened "
"recently on the Sydney Harbour Bridge,” explained Larissa, spokesperson for "
"the movement."

"Even in Mexico, where lockdown has come at a slower rate than other "
"countries, residents have been subject to extraordinary sightings. Melissa "
"Jiménez, from **Extinction Rebellion Mexico**, describes how “Caribbean "
"hotels usually teeming with holidaymakers are now welcoming a different sort "
"of guest; jaguars, leatherback turtles, great curassow birds and even "
"crocodiles have come too explore the silence we have left behind. Maybe, "
"when all this ends, we can find a way to coexist. in the meantime, we "
"celebrate this natural beauty, a welcome distraction from the fear and "
"uncertainty we are experiencing.”"

"The sample of experiences collected on this unusual and historic Earth Day "
"serve as a testament to the planet’s resilience and act as beacon of hope, "
"nature is encouraging us to pull through, to survive. Life will prevail as "
"large parts of the world experience the turmoil of lockdowns. In the "
"meantime, **Extinction Rebellion** will continue to strengthen and "
"consolidate its global   network of resilience to provide counsel, advice "
"and solidarity during this shared drama, and continue to be inspired by the "
"very life and nature we stand together and rebel for.\n"

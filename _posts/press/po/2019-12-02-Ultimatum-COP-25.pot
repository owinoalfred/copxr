msgid "*December 2nd, Madrid (SPAIN)* – Rebels from as many as 19 different nations and all walks of life descended upon the Spanish capital to deliver an Ultimatum to the global community as representatives gather for the 25th edition of the Conference of the Parties (COP), the United Nations’ (UN) yearly climate summit. Extinction Rebellion (XR) members have arrived to remind world leaders and citizens alike, while the conference could avoid the “inconvenience” of Chile’s social unrest, they cannot avoid the “inconvenience” of the climate and ecological crisis.\n"

"Madrid’s COP25 represents a true ultimatum for humankind and all ecosystems: "
"time has all but run out to avert the worst of the catastrophe our planet "
"faces. In the face of such unimaginable carnage, which scientists have been "
"warning about for over four decades, the only viable option is for a "
"massive, peaceful and democratic mobilization. The complexity surrounding "
"the cause and impacts of the crisis requires not just individual action, but "
"large-scale nonviolent mobilization to demand immediate change."

"Extinction Rebellion Spain will be hosting rebels from as many as 19 "
"countries and six continents, as part of the global contributions of XR "
"groups from local national and international circles who contribute all "
"around the world. Rebels for life will fill the streets, crowd Madrid’s "
"plazas, inviting onlookers to join the rebellion for life, as other capitals "
"act in solidarity. Through artistic, symbolic, disruptive actions, activists "
"will take up song and dance in the struggle for our children’s future, our "
"ecosystem and our natural treasures, sacrificed at the altar of "
"unencumbered, unsustainable growth. By claiming back the streets, XR "
"reiterates its global message of a democratic defense of the common good "
"made visible and within anybody’s reach. A brave few will not do, life is "
"everybody’s cause."

"Planet Earth’s citizens are increasingly aware, time is of the essence, "
"underscored by a year of globally coordinated demonstrations and rebellions. "
"At the same time, citizens of nations across the world are beginning to "
"manifest themselves against increasingly perceivable local injustices. From "
"Hong Kong, through France to Colombia, people’s discomfort with the status "
"quo is becoming ever evident. COP25, originally to be hosted by Brazil, was "
"moved from Santiago to Madrid due to the uncertainty posed by social "
"protests. However, these social protests are merely the beginning of "
"societal collapse triggered by an unsustainable global system so toxic the "
"environment is on the verge of absolute collapse. The climate crisis is not "
"just ecological. It is social, economic and cultural, and COP25 is just its "
"latest refugee."

"Now, in the midst of the first truly global humanitarian crisis, and 24 "
"years on from the first COP, the summit’s cause has become more crucial than "
"ever. Yet global commitment is criminally absent. Goals set out by previous "
"COPs, including Paris’ COP 21 celebrated agreement, and ignored in a "
"stubborn and suicidal pursuit of business as usual. A mere 16 countries out "
"of the 195 which signed the Paris Agreement are complying with it. "
"Meanwhile, the Amazon, Siberia, the Arctic and Koalas burn."

"The last 30 have been more disastrous than the two previous centuries: 60% "
"of the world’s species are endangered and we are on course for a 3oC global "
"temperature rise, according to 2018’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate "
"Change (IPCC) report. These glaring facts shed light on the effect of these "
"conferences. COP25 represents a final chance, an ultimatum, for leaders to "
"take responsibility and activate mechanisms on a global scale to reduce "
"deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. By Glasgow’s COP26, serious "
"inroads need to have been made if we even stand a chance to address even the "
"IPCC’s predictions."

"devastating bushfires, Extinction Rebellion (XR) climate activists in over "
"35 countries are holding solidarity actions with Extinction Rebellion "
"Australia’s Bushfire Rebellion outside Australian embassies and consulates "
"for the second week in a row. Countries, including Nigeria, Zambia, "
"Netherlands, Argentina, Uganda and Spain. Extinction Rebellion India, "

"The catastrophic mega blaze has already led to what scientists are "
"describing as an ecosystem and species apocalypse in Australia. Some "
"estimates state that up to 700 animal species have had their populations "
"decimated - with many species likely to be pushed to extinction including "
"the Long-footed potaroo, the Greater glider, the Kangaroo Island dunnart, "
"and the Black-tailed dusky antechinus, being obliterated from the face of "
"the Earth. “It would seem the only people willing to dismiss the scientific "
"correlation between the bushfire crisis and the climate crisis are those "
"massaged by the fossil fuel industry in the Australian government and those "
"who believe the propaganda of fossil fuel-interested media,” said Extinction "
"Rebellion Sydney spokesperson Larissa Payne."

"While we are on the verge of triggering a climatic point of no return, "
"German company Siemens agreed to participate in the development of the "
"world's largest coal mine. Siemens will supply the signage technology for "
"the railway line of the Carmichael coal mine in Galilee Basin, Australia, "
"quite literally signaling the way to the destruction of life on the Planet. "
"“Instead of demonstrating climate leadership and turning its back on one of "
"the many culprits, it chooses to of quite literally fuel fires around the "
"world, despite warnings from several environmental groups, ongoing protests, "
"and over 60 companies pulling out of the project. Siemens undoubtedly places "
"profit over the planet,” explains XR Germany spokesperson Annemarie Botski."

"life on Earth, even as the island continent’s species go extinct, “In the "
"same line, the Adani business group has obtained approvals for extracting "
"coal from the Carmichael coal mines in Australia. Fighting to saving our "
"planet has rightly turned global because the impact of forest fires in "
"Brazil, floods in Indonesia or fires in Australia are already being felt all "
"across our Earth. Such tragedies will only increase in intensity and in "
"terms of numbers,” says Extinction Rebellion India’s Jeevesh Gupta."

"“It is believed several animal and plant species have been rendered extinct "
"in the past few weeks. An estimated over half a billion animals have died in "
"this disaster. Much of the severity of conditions in the southern parts of "
"Australia can be attributed to massive amounts of land clearing in the past "
"century, leading to loss of rainfall, and no consultation or respect by "
"governments of the original Australians’ intact knowledge of caring for and "
"maintaining the land,” laments Australian First Nation spiritual leader Nick "
"Tree."

Two thirds of Australians want the government to declare a climate emergency and mobilize at World-war scale. We are living through the tipping point that the scientists have been warning us about - anything less than an emergency response condemns out children to an unlivable future,” concludes XR Australia spokesperson Jane Morton\n"

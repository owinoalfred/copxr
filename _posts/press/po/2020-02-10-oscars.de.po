"“I think we fear the idea of personal change because we think that we have "
"to sacrifice something, to give something up. But human beings at our best "
"are so inventive and creative and ingenious, and I think that when we use "
"love and compassion as our guiding principles, we can create, develop and "
"implement systems of change that are beneficial to all sentient beings and "
"to the environment,” stated the award winner to a room full of Hollywood’s "
"most influential members, with millions watching around the world."

"For Editors: Extinction Rebellion is a leaderless, decentralised, "
"international and non-partisan network using non-violent direct action and "
"civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and "
"Ecological Emergency.  The following three demands are shared across most "
"global chapters: 1. Tell the Truth: Government must tell the truth by "
"declaring a climate and ecological emergency, working with other "
"institutions to communicate the urgency for change.  2. Act Now: Government "
"must act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions "
"to net zero by 2025.  3. Beyond Politics: Government must create and be led "
"by the decisions of a Citizens’ Assembly on Climate and Ecological Justice."

"-   Greenhouse gas emissions objectives are insufficient. The climate and ecological emergency requires immediate and drastic action.\n"
"{:.huge .my-3}\n"
"January 21, 2020, (Madrid) - After a year of global climate rebellion, the climate and ecological emergency is taking its rightful place, as Spain joins a global movement, along with the UK, Ireland and France, and the European Parliament all of whom have acknowledged our desperate situation by declaring an emergency. Last September, hanging from a scaffold standing on melting ice in front of the Spanish Parliament, Spanish rebels personified our collective future if we don’t alter our course: humanity's extinction. On the same day, the rebellion for life officially delivered its three demands to the Spanish House of Representatives.\n"

"The declaration approved by the Spanish Council of Ministers takes a "
"substantial step towards fulfilling two of them: firstly, the truth must be "
"told regarding the climate and ecological emergency, and; the third, the "
"creation of citizens' assemblies to guide the process through representative "
"participation. Time is of the essence."

"The trigger for this political change has been the broad mobilization of "
"citizens who have taken to the streets to demand political leaders keep us "
"off \"a suicidal path for humanity,\" as UN Secretary General Antonio "
"Guterres has referred to our current situation.  Extinction Rebellion has "
"been at the heart of this shift in the global conversation, placing the "
"climate and ecological emergency at the heart of it. Building bridges and "
"cooperating with different groups and institutions, XR has been in large "
"part responsible for the massive response to government and corporate "
"inaction, using peaceful mass civil disobedience as its primary vehicle."

"Given the deadlines announced by the new government, XR calls for the need "
"to implement more ambitious decarbonisation targets. The scientific "
"community, in the latest IPCC report (2018), warns of how crucial it is not "
"to overstep a 1.5ºC rise in global temperatures this century. This implies a "
"drastic reduction in our emissions by 2030. With scientific data in hand, XR "
"urges the Spanish government to deepen the decisive green about-turn it "
"seems to be taking, by integrating deadlines set by science, as well as the "
"biophysical limits of the planet, along with the measures already announced. "
"The global community must recognize how absurd it is for infinite growth to "
"be a measure of success on a planet with limited resources. We are still in "
"time, just, to avoid a societal and ecological collapse."

"Extinction Rebellion welcomes Spain’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for "
"Ecological Transition, Teresa Ribera’s, advancement of urgent steps needed "
"to ensure a wide and inclusive participation of Spanish citizens who have a "
"crucial role to play in determining their collective future in light of the "
"climate and ecological emergency’s onslaught. Only [citizen’s assemblies]"
"(https://elpais.com/sociedad/2019/08/27/actualidad/1566899172_164145.html) "
"have the ability to make this a reality. Citizens must be empowered to "
"participate directly and effectively in national decision-making, guaranteed "
"by XR’s third demand. The recent example of the Convention citoyenne pour le "
"climat, initiated in France, is a dire warning of the risks citizens' "
"assemblies face if converted into workshops and debate forums with no teeth. "
"In light of this, XRSpain will work towards ensuring the effectiveness of "
"the promised Citizens' Assembly."

"During the coming months, the Spanish government will have to take concrete "

"Energy and Climate Plan (PNIEC). As such, it must demonstrate its commitment "

"on the cusp of becoming a regional, and even global, leader. Extinction "
"Rebellion challenges Spain to step up and rise to the occasion. Meanwhile, "
"and until this has been achieved, the global movement will continue to "
"mobilize and scale up the impact of its actions, in order to ensure carbon "
"emission cuts are in line with the science."

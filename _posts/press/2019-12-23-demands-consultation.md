Today Extinction Rebellion launches  [a consultation to create its new global demands, inviting feedback from the people around the world](https://forms.organise.earth/index.php?r=survey/index&sid=971934), whether involved with Extinction Rebellion or not. The provisional global demands are as follows and the thinking behind them can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CYAp4Y8nlL6jWHrj51v6_fskg65iU2FWAJD4GE1xO3I/edit#):

1.  TELL THE TRUTH – The international community must tell the truth and declare a planetary climate and ecological emergency.
2.  ACT NOW – The international community must act now to stop ecocide, halt biodiversity loss, reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2030 and adapt to our changing circumstances.
3.  BEYOND POLITICS – The international community must work to create and be led by Global Citizens’ Assemblies based on Justice, common mutual survival interest and wellbeing for all peoples and Life on Earth.

_“Extinction Rebellion’s national demands have helped to change the conversation around the world already, so that people are talking and thinking about what is possible by 2025, rather than 2050,_” said Sam Smithson of Extinction Rebellion UK.

_“Now is the time to think global – and Extinction Rebellion is thinking we need a ten year plan globally. These global demands are intended to open up the necessary conversation now, they are an offering to the world and we look forward to getting your feedback so that as we move beyond this COP to 2020 looking to Glasgow next year, together we can literally change what is possible in this world.”_
